<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>I am extremely amazed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call business several years earlier and understand the significance of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also impressed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
