<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. When I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the rate terrific but Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my home to make the total air flow more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
