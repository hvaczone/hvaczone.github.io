<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so deal with your contractor to find a place that's not near a bed room or home-office window.

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air.

Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide should be adjusted regularly, and outside measurements used for estimations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors might also be necessary.<p>
