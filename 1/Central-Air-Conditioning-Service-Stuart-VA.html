<p>The quality of the air inside our homes, work environments and schools matters, especially given that we invest the majority of our lives indoors. Air conditioners assist to dehumidify the incoming air, but in extremely damp environments or in cases where the a/c unit is oversized, it may not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the a/c unit will need more energy to cool your home. A more effective alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be added as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
<p>HVAC Systems Can Add To Air Quality Issues. HVAC systems can also exacerbate indoor air quality problems. The HVAC system may be infected (due to the fact that of mold in duct lining or bacteria on coil or filters, for instance), and the system might spread these contaminants throughout the home. Second, the HVAC duct distribution system can spread pollutants from one portion of the home to another. Regular maintenance and duct sealing can assist decrease these problems.<p>

Depending upon the website and insect to be managed, several of the following actions can be effective: usage of biological pesticides, such as Bacillus thuringiensis, for the control of gypsy moths; choice of disease-resistant plants; and frequent washing of indoor plants and pets. Termite damage can be lowered or avoided by making sure that wood building materials do not come into direct contact with the soil and by storing firewood away from the house.
