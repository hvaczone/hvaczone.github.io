<h3>HVAC Systems Are Essential for All Homes and Offices in Owensboro KY</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy.

The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh makeup air dilutes indoor impurities and assists exhaust them from the house.<p>
