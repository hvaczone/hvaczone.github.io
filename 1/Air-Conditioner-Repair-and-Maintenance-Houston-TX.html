Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

It might be in best condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more effective model, then you would be squandering cash by not replacing the older system.<p>
