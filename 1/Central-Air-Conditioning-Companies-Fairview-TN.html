<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The very same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it circulates through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
<p>HVAC Systems Can Contribute to Air Quality Problems. HVAC systems can likewise exacerbate indoor air quality problems. The HVAC system might be polluted (since of mold in duct lining or germs on coil or filters, for instance), and the system may spread these contaminants throughout the home. Second, the HVAC duct distribution system can spread toxins from one portion of the home to another. Routine maintenance and duct sealing can help reduce these issues.<p>

Location control includes moving the contaminant source away from occupants and even relocating vulnerable residents.<p>
