<p>The federal government recommends that homes be weatherized in order to minimize the amount of energy required for heating & cooling. While weatherization is underway, nevertheless, actions need to also be required to reduce contamination from sources inside the house.

<p>EER represents Energy Performance Ratio. The energy performance of central air systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people don't use this measurement much anymore.<p>
