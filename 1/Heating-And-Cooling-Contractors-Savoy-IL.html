It has also been shown to cause cancer in animals and might trigger cancer in human beings.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you wouldn't use them.. Secondly like extended automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the required skills to do the job and also the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a consumer you require to be well notified in order not to be completely benefited from. The majority of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to correctly service and the system has actually been operating issue complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
