As an initial step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set more powerful indoor standards based on the most current science for NO2.

<p>Air conditioning can likewise be offered by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>
