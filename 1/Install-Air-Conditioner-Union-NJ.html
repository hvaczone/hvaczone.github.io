<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. Since as much as 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system might be lost to leakages in your ducts, a ductless system has a built-in effectiveness advantage. Ductless heat pumps are great for additions due to the fact that they do not require any new ductwork to be set up. Since a system is installed in each room or location you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature level in the room when you are present.<p>

<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that gain access to would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network.
