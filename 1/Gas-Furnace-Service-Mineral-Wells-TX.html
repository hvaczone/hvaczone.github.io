In other cases, such modifications subtly and even dramatically alter buildings in manner ins which may be necessary to their own stability or their influence on building occupants through the development of the physical, chemical, and biological procedures that define them at any time. We may find it beneficial to integrate the tools of the physical sciences with those of the biological sciences and, especially, some of the approaches used by researchers studying ecosystems, in order to get a boosted understanding of the environments in which we invest most of our time, our buildings.<p>

<p>The primary health effect related to exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
