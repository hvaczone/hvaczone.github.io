<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not use automobile debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of money coming in every month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer automobile debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There should not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
