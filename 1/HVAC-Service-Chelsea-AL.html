<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (most of the times) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI safeguarded.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance circuit breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
