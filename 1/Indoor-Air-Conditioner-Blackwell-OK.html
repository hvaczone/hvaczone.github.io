<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either since of noticeable growth or a musty smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and inspect. Dripping return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you presume a mold issue, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>2. Keep a healthy level of humidity. Allergen and mold love wetness. Keeping humidity around 30% -50% helps keep them and other irritants under control.

An air conditioning system also minimizes indoor pollen count - another plus for allergy -victims.<p>
