Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no concerns besides the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
