Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
