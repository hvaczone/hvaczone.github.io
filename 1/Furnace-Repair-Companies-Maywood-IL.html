<h3>The Way to Get Your HVAC Certification and HVAC Licensing at Maywood IL</h3>

<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might require a referral in the future). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've swapped all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
