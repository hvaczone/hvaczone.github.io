<p>When mounting a wall sensor, consider the height at which they must be put. Many frequently they are mounted at height-level or somewhat lower, if individuals primarily stay seated in that specific area. However, the molecular weight of some compounds makes them gravitate toward the floor or ceiling; depending on what contaminant you're attempting to track you'll need to position the sensor accordingly. For instance, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air and so the highest concentrations inside buildings are usually near the ceiling. On the other hand, ozone is heavier than air and remains near the floor.<p>
