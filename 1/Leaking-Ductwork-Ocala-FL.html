<p>Radiant heating covers a range of various heater, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on similar principles. In the case of a boiler, the system warms by distributing hot water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the space.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered force in 2000 and prohibited the use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Policy prohibited using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that equipment that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
