<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible sign of ventilation adequacy.

<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you need to examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
