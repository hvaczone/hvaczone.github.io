<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality issues in homes. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in sufficient outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air contaminants out of the house. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outside unit as close to the house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
