But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance circuit breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
