<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
