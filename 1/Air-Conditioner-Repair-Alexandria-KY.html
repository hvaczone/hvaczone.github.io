<p>AC systems and thermostats have built-in delay functions when they're shut down and then repowered. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually signed up for an energy-saving device from your local power energy, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts shown and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature listed below the indoor temperature level, and the unit does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on. Over time, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll notice the motor running hotter. Before that takes place, you wish to get those capacitors changed to avoid more damage to your system.<p>
