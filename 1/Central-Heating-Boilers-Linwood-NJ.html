<p>If you think a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and maintain. Leaky return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you suspect a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>

A dehumidifier (and a/c during summer season) helps in reducing moisture in indoor air and effectively manages irritants, Lang says. An air conditioning unit likewise reduces indoor pollen count - another plus for allergic reaction -patients.<p>
