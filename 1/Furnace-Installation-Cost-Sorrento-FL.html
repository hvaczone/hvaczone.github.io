<p>It might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't give off heat effectively and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can take place with time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must suffice until you purchase a replacement-- which you should do quickly.<p>
<p>As a number of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant devices manufacturer's to guarantee your factory warranties stay in place. Moreover, the tangible outcomes of a PM is often hard to quantify, as one reaction stated the savings in performance or repairs that were prevented. A lot of pieces of a furnace or a/c unit don't simply break at the snap of a finger, however instead is the outcome of recurring use of an element that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon since the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and causing premature deterioration, causing holes and fractures. , if that client had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and secures the component.. a really helpful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a client thousands.<p>
