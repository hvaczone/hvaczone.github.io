<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them up until they have actually been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up. If goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you must look out for. Initially, you must examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
