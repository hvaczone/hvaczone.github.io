Ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions since they don't need any new ductwork to be installed. Due to the fact that a system is set up in each room or location you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that instantly raise the temperature level in the room when you are present.<p>
