<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for ac system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
