<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you need to look out for. First, you need to inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
