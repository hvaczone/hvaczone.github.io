<p>Fact: Geothermal systems actually take in no water. All the water is returned to that very same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth.

Nevertheless, given that all elements of the dehumidifier remain in the same space, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the space is really heated up, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the very same amount of power.<p>
