<h3>AC Compressor Repair in Kenner LA 70065</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile tube) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
