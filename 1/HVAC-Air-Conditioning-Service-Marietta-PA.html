<p>The federal government recommends that homes be weatherized in order to lower the quantity of energy required for heating and cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, steps need to likewise be taken to decrease pollution from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for recommended actions.)

Additional weatherization steps must not be undertaken up until these issues have been fixed.<p>

Individuals at specific threat from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and people with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
