<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Contractors in Mary Esther</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace service technicians frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Look for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most common reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too rapidly, and your home will not warm up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, change the filter. An unclean filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping in between a outside and indoor system rather of ducting air directly from the outside unit.
