In general, they cost in between $2,000 and $8,000 to set up. In general, they provide an AFUE rating of between 80 and 90 percent.<p>

So, while it might appear like a short-term larger cost, a new, more energy-efficient house heater will more than most likely save you money in the longer-term by lowering your annual energy costs.<p>

<p>Co2 (CO2) may not be the most pernicious factor affecting indoor air quality, but it is typically utilized as a surrogate for air quality and building tenancy level. The more occupants there are in a space or structure, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from increasing too expensive-- which can have an unfavorable effect on residents-- outside air needs to be deliberately brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
