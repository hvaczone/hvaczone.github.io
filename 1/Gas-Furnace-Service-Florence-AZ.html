<p>SysTech Design specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The very same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it distributes through your house. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outside system as near your home as possible per my request. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
