<p>Central air conditioning units are determined in loads. This measurement is based upon the system's ability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 lot system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it suggests the amount of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was extremely valuable in collecting details on the phone and providing clear guidelines about how to briefly handle the problem and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day.

The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will absolutely use Stability Energy Systems again, for office and home.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your house that ideal temperature level throughout the year.

So, make sure to change your AC filters regularly, or get an air conditioning service strategy which typically includes a filter change - especially if you are allergy-prone or reside in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>
