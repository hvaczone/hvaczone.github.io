<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

Using existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to set up an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
