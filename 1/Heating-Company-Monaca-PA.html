<p>The primary problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, employees try to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system creates more difficulties, since a few of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>
