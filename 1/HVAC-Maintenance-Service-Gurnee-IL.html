Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils.

It also prevents water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
<p>For instance, pollutants might collect within the air diffusers and grills, introducing toxins into the environment. Or if the outside air intake lies near a source of wetness or other outside contaminant, it may serve as a pathway to bring the impurities inside.
