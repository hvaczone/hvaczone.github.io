<h3>Comparing Commercial Boilers to Residential Boilers at Stoughton MA</h3>
<p>All modern-day air conditioning systems, even little window plan units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be changed or cleaned as conditions require. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will need to have the filters altered more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Furthermore, extremely unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>

When the temperature falls listed below a threshold, both the fan and compressor are shut down to mitigate more temperature drops; explanation needed this prevents moisture on the evaporator from being blown back into the room. citation required When the temperature increases again, explanation required the compressor restarts and the fan returns to low speed.<p>
