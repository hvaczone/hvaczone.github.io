<p>The EPA advises that you have your duct examined by an expert heating and cooling contractor.

<p>Particular instant results are similar to those from colds or other viral illness, so it is typically difficult to figure out if the signs are a result of direct exposure to indoor air contamination. For this factor, it is essential to focus on the time and place the signs take place. If the signs fade or go away when a person is away from the home and return when the individual returns, an effort should be made to identify indoor air sources that might be possible causes.

<p>A geothermal heating system is more reliable than alternatives, and is not affected by any external elements, unlike other renewable resources such as wind energy and solar power. For instance, wind energy can only be used when there is wind, while solar energy depends on regular sunshine to work effectively. Geothermal heating depends on neither the wind nor the sun, however rather takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is always hot. This makes geothermal heating a dependable and readily available source of energy.<p>

Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might present risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your risk of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
