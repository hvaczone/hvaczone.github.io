<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
