<p>When the heatpump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very helpful in collecting information on the phone and offering clear instructions about how to briefly handle the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and offered clear communication about the problem, its treatments, and its future avoidance.
