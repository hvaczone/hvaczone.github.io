<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork at Portsmouth OH</h3>
<p>All modern-day air conditioning systems, even little window bundle units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and must be replaced or washed as conditions require. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will require to have the filters altered more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Furthermore, very filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is normally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
