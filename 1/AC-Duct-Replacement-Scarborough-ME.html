<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. These convection heaters are still commonly used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>

<p>A geothermal heater is more trustworthy than options, and is not affected by any external elements, unlike other renewable resources such as wind energy and solar energy. For example, wind energy can only be used when there is wind, while solar energy depends on routine sunlight to work effectively. Geothermal heating depends on neither the wind nor the sun, but instead takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is constantly hot. This makes geothermal heating a dependable and readily available source of energy.<p>
