<p>A lot of central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct.
