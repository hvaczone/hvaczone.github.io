A/c unit help to dehumidify the incoming air, however in very humid climates or in cases where the air conditioning unit is oversized, it may not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the air conditioner will need more energy to cool your house. A preferable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to a lot of existing systems.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up routinely, they can become clogged with debris that can restrict air flow, possibly affecting your comfort and your system's effectiveness.

As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, generally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
