<p>Indoor environments are extremely intricate and building residents may be exposed to a range of contaminants (in the kind of particles and gases) from office machines, cleaning products, building and construction carpets, activities and home furnishings, perfumes, cigarette smoke, water-damaged structure materials, microbial growth (fungal, mold, and bacterial), bugs, and outdoor pollutants. Other elements such as indoor temperature levels, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can likewise affect how individuals respond to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help determine the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness. The goal is to offer sufficient changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this. A common aspect needed in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
