<h3>The Most Frequent Reasons For Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>

These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like material, and need to be changed or cleaned as conditions require.

Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Furthermore, extremely filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil.
