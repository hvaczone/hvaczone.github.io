Luis was the sixth person, who described to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event. When I called and he recommended me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working once again, he assisted me trouble shoot the concern. He is honest, reputable, and reasonable on cost. It's hard to find an honest AC person and I'm happy I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
