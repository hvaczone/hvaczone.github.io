<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile hose) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>

<p>Air pollutants can vary from impurities brought in from the outdoors by your family pets to harmful gas leakages.

Older homes may consist of asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when released into the air. In bathrooms and kitchen areas, mold and mildew can become a nuisance where wetness levels are usually greater than in the rest of your home.<p>
