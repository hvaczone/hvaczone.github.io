Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

<p>Geothermal heatpump are exceptionally efficient, due to the fact that ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature level is constantly at a consistent temperature. These systems can attain a geothermal efficiency of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heatpump can only obtain an efficiency of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Similar to other kinds of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal efficiency ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE OFFICER). POLICE rates how much heat a system produces or eliminates (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to develop the heating or cooling effect. Most ground source heat pumps have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this indicates is that for each system of energy used by a geothermal heatpump, roughly 3 to 5 units are supplied back in the form of heat.<p>
