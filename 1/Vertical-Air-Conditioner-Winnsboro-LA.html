<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise because 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one restriction: their total power needs to not go beyond the capability of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is very common to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor units higher than the outdoor capacity by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to expect much better efficiency when all indoor units are turned on at the very same time, because the total capacity of the entire system is restricted by the capability of the outdoor system. Simply put, the outdoor system will disperse all its power to all running indoor systems in such a way that a few of the rooms may not have a really comfy temperature level. However, the calculation of the overall power is not simple, because it considers not just the small power of the systems, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
