<p>Instant discounts on high-efficiency heatpump innovations are available to equipment installers, used at the wholesaler or supplier point-of-purchase. Exceptional Client Service! Environment Pro is reputable and really cared about us and our situation. We came home one night to a cold house. I called Environment Pro, and Warren came by that exact same night. Although he didn't have actually the required replacement part in his van, he changed his schedule so he could look for and purchase it the next early morning. Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was definitely happy to have a heated house again. What's most amazing was that this all happened throughout Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd discover somebody to assist us right prior to a vacation, but Climate Pro came through for us. I will gladly advise this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the cost fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
