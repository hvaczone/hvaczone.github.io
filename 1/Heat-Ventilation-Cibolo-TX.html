<p>WE ARE ALSO OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe between the water pipe entering and the water pipe leaving the conventional hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the standard hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the conventional water heater.

<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump.

An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the invoice before work started. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
