<p>When I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 heating systems were not working, integrity Energy was quick to react. They showed up the next day and changed two heaters and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday until the brand-new heaters can heat the house. Honestly, our house heating unit is made complex, Rob and his group repaired the old duct, changed all the dampers, make the whole system work perfectly.<p>
<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have issues, they give me concern and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended warranties or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>
