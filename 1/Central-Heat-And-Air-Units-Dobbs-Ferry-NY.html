<h3>Heat Pumps: What Are They And How Do They Function in Dobbs Ferry NY?</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, performed a study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by improving air flow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, measured particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the uniform heat circulation over the entire surface area of a flooring warms the lower half of the space, enveloping residents in warmth at a lower general temperature-- sometimes as much as 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a standard heating system." In other words, in-floor heating systems supply a different mode and level of convenience. And, as different public awareness projects have long advised us, the more comfortable we feel, the more likely we might be to push down our thermostat, in turn lowering our energy expenses.<p>
