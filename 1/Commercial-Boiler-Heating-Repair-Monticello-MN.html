Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the traditional water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes entering and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the traditional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the traditional water heater can be shut off entirely.<p>

<p>You might decide to keep your service and product line simple for now if you're in the first few years of service.

<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Proper Duct Sealing in Monticello MN</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went excellent. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to remove the old hot water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heating system. We decided on getting something more expensive than a standard water heater as gas is one of our greatest utility expenditures. We feel that this new unit will last a long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>The condensate drain in your a/c and heatpump must be free of all obstructions and debris. Blockages can obstruct the flow of condensed water and cause moisture accumulation within the system. Excess wetness can cause problems like mold, water damage, high levels of humidity in the residential or commercial property, irregular temperature policy, bacteria, and compromised air quality. An expert maintenance technician will flush and clean the condensate drain to ensure all excess wetness streams far from the system.<p>
