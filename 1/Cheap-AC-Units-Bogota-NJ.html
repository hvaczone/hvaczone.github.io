<p>Appropriate ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's simple to believe that the air quality outside is even worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are frequently 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and sometimes these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the very same toxins. Simply put, often the air inside can be more hazardous than the air outside.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat increases, so it makes good sense to locate the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the warmth naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area. All items in the hot zone reach balance in temperature after the radiant heat system has been running for a while, including individuals. When the furnace kicks in and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a procedure called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area.

Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its efficiency.<p>
