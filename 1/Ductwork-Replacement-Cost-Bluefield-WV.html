<h3>Residential and Commercial HVAC Services in Bluefield WV</h3>
<p>In the last several years, a growing body of scientific evidence has shown that the air within houses and other structures can be more seriously contaminated than the outside air in even the biggest and most industrialized cities. Other research indicates that individuals invest roughly 90 percent of their time indoors. Thus, for many individuals, the dangers to health might be greater due to direct exposure to air contamination inside your home than outdoors.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
