<h3>The Way to Soundproof a Central Heating System in Alpine CA</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The existing pattern in house building is to minimize air leakage through fractures and other openings in walls, roofings, and floors. The combination of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually led to a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much greater. This fresh makeup air helps and dilutes indoor pollutants tire them from the home.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
