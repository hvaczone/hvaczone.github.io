<p>In a split-system central air conditioner, an outside metal cabinet consists of the condenser and compressor, and an indoor cabinet consists of the evaporator. In lots of split-system a/c unit, this indoor cabinet likewise contains a furnace or the indoor part of a heat pump.

A split-system is the most economical central air conditioner to set up if your home already has no air however a furnace conditioner.<p>
<h3>Furnace Installation Cost in Southampton New York</h3>
<p>It is still possible that an indoor air pollution problem exists if no contaminant sources are found. Excessive re-circulation of air leads to "stale air" conditions. Stagnant air has greater levels of co2 and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air. Stale air may also be a problem when ventilation is not sufficient to represent a boost in the number of workers in the area.<p>
<p>There is no single test to discover an IAQ problem. Your company should check measurements of temperature, humidity and air circulation. In addition, inspection and screening of the ventilation, heating and air conditioning systems (to make certain it is working according to requirements for building usage and tenancy) ought to be performed. A building walk-through to check for smells and try to find water damage, leaks, dirt or insect droppings might be practical. Leaks need to be eliminated. Standing water in humidifiers, a/c units, on roofing systems and in boiler pans can become polluted with germs or fungis and need to be removed, likewise. In some situations, specific testing for radon or for asbestos might be required as part of building occupancy. For example, in schools asbestos requires to be checked every three years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act-AHERA).<p>
<p>Re-install the gain access to panel and disconnect block. Turn on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and await the AC to begin (see Be Patient at Start-up," below). The compressor needs to run and the condenser fan ought to spin. If the compressor starts however the fan doesn't, the fan motor is most likely shot. Shut down the power and eliminate the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and eliminate the fan blade and motor (Picture 7). Re-install the blade and protect the cover. Then see and repower the unit if the fan begins. If  it does not, you've provided it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
