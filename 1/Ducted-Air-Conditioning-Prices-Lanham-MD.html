<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have provided an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity expert at a large merchant who asked not to be named due to the fact that he did not have permission to speak on the record, it prevails for big retail operations to have a team that regularly keeps track of energy usage and temperatures in stores to save money on expenses (especially at night) and to alert store managers if temperatures in the shops fluctuate beyond an appropriate variety that could prevent clients from shopping at the shop.<p>
<p>There is no simple answer, however many utilize the rule of thumb that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, changing is probably a better solution. If the existing system has actually not sustained other significant repairs, remains in otherwise outstanding condition, and issues that resulted in the breakdown can be recognized and corrected, repairing the system can make a lot of sense as well.<p>
