In truth, the true nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
