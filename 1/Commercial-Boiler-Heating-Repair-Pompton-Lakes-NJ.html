<p>Air conditioning can likewise be provided by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area.

Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage.
