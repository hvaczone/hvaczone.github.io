There can be a major threat from the cumulative effects of these sources. Fortunately, there are actions that many people can take both to reduce the risk from existing sources and to avoid brand-new issues from taking place. This security guide was prepared by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Consumer Product Security Commission (CPSC) to assist you decide whether to act that can lower the level of indoor air pollution in your own home.<p>
<p>Prior to you head out and purchase an air conditioning system, there are a few things to decide initially. Where are you going to be setting up the air conditioning unit? If your home is not equipped with ductwork, do you wish to set up some or go ductless? How large should the ac system be? Too big and you'll run into issues with short-cycling, which can damage the ac system and reduce its life. Too little and your air conditioning system won't be able to cool your home appropriately.
