<p>Cooling can likewise be supplied by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.<p>
<p>When auto cooling systems break down, refrigerant leaks. Not just is refrigerant hazardous to the environment, it's likewise harmful to your cars and truck.

Glycol piping and external heat exchangers should be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be secured by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside must be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>
