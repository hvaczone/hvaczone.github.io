<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Recent Review: They were fantastic! Numerous HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to provide you with the service initially requested. They fulfilled my needs completely by providing a professional quote with choices, without pressing additional products. The team showed up on time, kept me informed as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also immediately followed up with the essential inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely advise this company.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness. The objective is to provide sufficient changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to achieve this. A typical component needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
