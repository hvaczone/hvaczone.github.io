<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you ought to inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
