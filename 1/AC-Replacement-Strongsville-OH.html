<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Dirty filters are the most common cause of furnace issues.

<h3>The Benefits of Buying A New Furnace at Strongsville OH</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, sending the absorbed heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression procedure. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating unit.<p>
