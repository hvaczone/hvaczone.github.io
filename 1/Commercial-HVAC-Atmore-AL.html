The reduced airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the problem.<p>
