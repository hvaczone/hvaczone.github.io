<p>Oil furnaces are usually not very effective. They use less fuel than other furnace types, however many do not achieve a performance greater than 90%. A couple of high-end brands have an efficiency of 95% by utilizing a condenser. These are more costly, having beginning expenses for the furnace itself at around $5,000.
