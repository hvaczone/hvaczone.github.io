<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pushing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you select them up, do decline them until they have actually been effectively dried. If items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent sees, try a various dry cleaner.<p>
