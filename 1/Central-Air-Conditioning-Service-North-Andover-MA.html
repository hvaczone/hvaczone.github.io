<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just eight to ten years old, it might flatter two times the electrical power that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's because it runs at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to offer a particular cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but nowadays, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling expenses than equipment installed simply a couple of years ago.<p>
