<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat.

<p>Moreover, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms heated by radiators are prone to cold areas", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and extremely hot beside the radiators.
