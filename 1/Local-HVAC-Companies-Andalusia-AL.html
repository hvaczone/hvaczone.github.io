However, better brand names usually come with a longer life-span, much better warranties, and smarter technology integrated in to totally control your home's temperature level.<p>
<p>Ask about training and certifications. A great place to start is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) accreditation. It's type of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, however a great deal of contractors out there haven't bothered with it!

This might be through a public offering, a sale to a large service in the field, or even a sale to another PE firm. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE firm Ares Management. Ares purchased CoolSys from Audex, another PE company, previously this year. Audex had owned CoolSys for three years before that.<p>
