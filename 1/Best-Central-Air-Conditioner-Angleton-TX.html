<p>We look at clues prior to we provide advice to replace instead of repair a heating system. Among the clues we look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to use, or if energy bills are higher every year, we understand the unit is not running efficiently. It might be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more effective design, then you would be losing cash by not changing the older system.<p>
<p>Dirty Filters: Ã¢ $ " Ã Filters clogged with dust, family pet hair and other debris lead to issues like failure to provide appropriate heat, excess sound and the furnace running all the time. If you find the problem and have a washable filter, thereÃ¢ $ s no charge. Do It Yourself filter replacement alternatives range from $3 to $40, and you get what you spend for. That might be a really pricey dirty-filter diagnosis if the technician comes to your house.
