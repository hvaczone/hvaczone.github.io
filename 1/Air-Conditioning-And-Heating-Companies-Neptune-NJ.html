Many typical building materials used prior to 1975 contain asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heater, pipeline wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Usually, significant releases of asbestos fiber do not take place unless the structure materials are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building renovation.

For systems needing just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and performing far much better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "cheap" by many individuals.<p>
