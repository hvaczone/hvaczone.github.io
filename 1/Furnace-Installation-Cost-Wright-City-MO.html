<p>Next, and maybe just as essential when it comes to central air conditioning expenses, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too big will have a simple time keeping the home cool, however will have a more difficult time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not have the ability to appropriately cool the house on hot days. Thinking about bigger systems cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air system needs to hold.<p>
<p>Nearly half of Americans use air fresheners at least once a week, and 34 percent use candles or incense that regularly, our nationally representative study found. Approximately 40 percent rarely or never ever clean their humidifier or cooking area range hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have never ever cleaned or replaced their furnace filter. And nearly 20 percent still smoke in the house or let others smoke there. All of those things can worsen indoor air quality.<p>
