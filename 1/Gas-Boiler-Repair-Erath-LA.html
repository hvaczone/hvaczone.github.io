In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the inbound air is minimized, however it is likewise more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same.

<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just eight to ten years old, it might suck up to two times the electrical power that even a low-end new one would utilize. That's due to the fact that it operates at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to supply a particular cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however nowadays, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment installed simply a couple of years ago.<p>
