<p>It is common to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment).

In truth, the true nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
