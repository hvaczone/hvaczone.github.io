<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you must look out for. Initially, you ought to check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
