<h3>Components of a High Efficiency Furnace at Kemp TX</h3>

<p>Both must be kept clean because an air conditioner moves heat in between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil. This means that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also required to routinely clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually lead to damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
