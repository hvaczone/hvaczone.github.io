(If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI secured.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>

There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
