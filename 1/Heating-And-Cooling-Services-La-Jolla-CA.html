<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you wouldn't use them.. Second of all like prolonged auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the necessary abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a consumer you require to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. Many companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly found someone to effectively service and the system has been running issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
