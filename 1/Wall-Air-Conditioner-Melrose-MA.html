<h3>The Benefits of Regular HVAC Maintenance in Melrose MA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, performed a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by improving airflow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy performance. In some cases, determined particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Since pesticides can be discovered far from the site of their original application, it is prudent to lower making use of chemical pesticides outdoors as well as inside. Depending upon the site and pest to be managed, one or more of the following steps can be reliable: use of biological pesticides, such as Bacillus thuringiensis, for the control of gypsy moths; choice of disease-resistant plants; and regular washing of indoor plants and animals. Termite damage can be lowered or avoided by making certain that wood building materials do not enter direct contact with the soil and by storing fire wood far from the home. By properly fertilizing, watering, and aerating lawns, the requirement for chemical pesticide treatments of lawns can be significantly minimized.<p>
