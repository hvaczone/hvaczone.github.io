<p>Factors that can contribute to the development of biological impurities are wet or damp building materials (carpeting, ceilings, walls) and badly maintained humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioning unit. "Humidifier fever" is a typical health problem triggered by incorrect maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and persistent coughs.

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you wouldn't offer them.. Second of all like extended automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required abilities to do the task and also the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely benefited from. The majority of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally found somebody to appropriately service and the system has actually been operating issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
