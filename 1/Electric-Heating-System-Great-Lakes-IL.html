<p>Your lungs are accountable for bringing fresh air into your body, while simultaneously eliminating waste gases and particulates. Needless to say, the more particles that are in the air you breathe, the harder it is for your lungs to eliminate them. Poor air quality - whether it is indoors or outdoors - can make it significantly hard for your lungs to function correctly, and can have unfavorable health affects.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you would not use them.  Second of all like prolonged vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the needed abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a client you require to be well notified in order not to be totally made the most of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to correctly service and the unit has actually been running problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
