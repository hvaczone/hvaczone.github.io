<p>Indoor air quality (likewise called "indoor ecological quality") describes how within air can impact an individual's comfort, ability, and health to work. It can consist of temperature, humidity, absence of outdoors air (poor ventilation), mold from water damage, or direct exposure to other chemicals. Presently, OSHA has no indoor air quality (IAQ) standards however it does provide guidelines about the most common IAQ work environment problems.<p>
<p>A customized ac system that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic air conditioning unit because both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the exact same air course. Because its condenser coil launches heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. However, because all elements of the dehumidifier remain in the same room, no heat energy is removed. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the space is actually heated, just as by an electric heater that draws the exact same amount of power.<p>

<p>Cooling can also be provided by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>
