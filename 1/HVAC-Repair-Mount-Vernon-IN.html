<p>The first air conditioners and refrigerators used combustible or poisonous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that could result in deadly accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928.

The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most utilized in direct-expansion home and structure convenience cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<h3>Preventive HVAC Maintenance in Mount Vernon IN</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to remove the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heating system. We decided on getting something more expensive than a standard hot water heater as gas is among our biggest utility expenses. We feel that this new unit will last a very long time and usage extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
