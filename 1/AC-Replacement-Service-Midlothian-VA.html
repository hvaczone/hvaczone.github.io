<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives ask for assessment and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation procedure. Nevertheless, many of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed several years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>Duct are accountable for distributing cold and hot air throughout your home, providing a comfy environment in every room. However ducts that are not set up effectively or kept can distribute pollutants from one space to another.

<p>The majority of central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the cooling system.

When the air conditioner works but the house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
