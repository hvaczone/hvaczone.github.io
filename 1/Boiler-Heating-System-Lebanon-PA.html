<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' cause a problem in the future.

<p>Open windows or utilize exhaust fans. Ventilation, a common method of reducing direct exposure to indoor air toxins, also will minimize but not eliminate exposure to ecological tobacco smoke. Due to the fact that smoking cigarettes produces such big quantities of toxins, natural or mechanical ventilation methods do not remove them from the air in your house as quickly as they build up. In addition, the big boosts in ventilation it takes to substantially minimize direct exposure to ecological tobacco smoke can likewise increase energy costs considerably. As a result, the most effective method to lower direct exposure to ecological tobacco smoke in the home is to get rid of cigarette smoking there.<p>
