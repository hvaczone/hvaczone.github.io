<p>Sean was very valuable. He is a very enjoyable individual to deal with. No pressure applied to purchase additional things. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no problems other than the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
