These convection heaters are still commonly utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a big central air conditioning conditioner unit that sits outdoors your house. Heatpump operate on electrical energy and work like air conditioners in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This allows them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a standard electric heater (like an area heating unit) with the exact same amount of electricity. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
