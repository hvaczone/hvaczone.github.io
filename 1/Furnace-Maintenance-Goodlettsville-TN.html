<p>Old lead-based paint is the most significant source of lead exposure in the U.S. today. Hazardous exposures to lead can be created when lead-based paint is poorly eliminated from surface areas by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning.

<p>Ventilation: Decreasing pollutant concentration by utilizing cleaner (outside) air to dilute contaminated (indoor) air. Local building codes most likely specify the quantity (and often quality) of outside air that need to be continuously provided in your structures, as do voluntary requirements set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Temporarily increasing ventilation combined with appropriate usage of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for instance, can be helpful in diluting the concentration of poisonous fumes in the air.<p>
