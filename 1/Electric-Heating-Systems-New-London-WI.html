<p>The quality of the air inside our homes, workplaces and schools matters, particularly given that we spend the majority of our lives inside your home. Air conditioners help to dehumidify the incoming air, but in exceptionally damp environments or in cases where the air conditioning unit is oversized, it may not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the a/c unit will need more energy to cool your house. A more suitable option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to the majority of existing systems.<p>

<p>An undersize system won't be able to cool spaces down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate since it needs to run longer than a properly sized unit. An oversize compressor also costs more to operate because it simply takes more electricity to run a larger system. And a large-scale system doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has a possibility to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary wetness. The outcome is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature suggests. In truth, the space can feel damp and clammy.<p>
