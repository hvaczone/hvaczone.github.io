<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a reasonably easy to determine surrogate for indoor contaminants released by humans, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are unusually high inside might trigger occupants to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to operate at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are usually 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level considered acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Human beings are the primary indoor source of co2 in a lot of structures. Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
