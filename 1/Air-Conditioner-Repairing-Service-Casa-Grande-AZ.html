This would be an instance where you should contact an expert to check and repair the system.<p>

<h3>The Benefits of Regular HVAC Maintenance at Casa Grande AZ</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Four Seasons has installed both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have actually discovered them to be reasonably priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my primary furnace they went well beyond what was necessary and redid the entire plenum and the duct for the water heater because the service technicians thought they just didn't seem ideal and they couldn't leave them that way. No extra charge.<p>
