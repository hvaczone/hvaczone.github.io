<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not provide them.. Secondly like prolonged auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the essential abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a consumer you require to be well notified in order not to be entirely benefited from. A lot of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have.
