<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the average house. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the inbound air is minimized, however it is likewise more humid, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the getting in air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather substantial if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
<p>Apartment or condos can have the same indoor air problems as single-family houses since many of the pollution sources, such as the interior structure products, home furnishings, and household items, are similar.
