Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
