<p>It prevails to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable in time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment).

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
