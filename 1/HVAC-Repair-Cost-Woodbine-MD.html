<p>How environment modification affects air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for modern-day air conditioners) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioner boost. This boost has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c removes that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system must increase its power usage by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
