<p>Airflow patterns in building are figured out by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural effects. Air pressure differences developed by these forces move air-borne toxins from areas of greater pressure to areas of lower pressure through any readily available opening in building walls, ceilings, floorings, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is little, air will move till the inside pressure is equal to the outside.<p>
<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to change your filters regularly, they're not joking. It's as crucial as a routine oil change in your cars and truck.

Furthermore, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps pollutants and debris in the air. Energy Star recommends changing your filter when every 3 months. During high usage months, check the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>

For instance, a heat exchanger might stop working too soon since the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and causing early degeneration, resulting in holes and cracks. If that customer had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and protects the component.  an extremely advantageous result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
