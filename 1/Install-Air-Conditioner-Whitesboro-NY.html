You might look for a heat pump more geared toward cooling capacity and efficiency if you currently have a home heating system. For a higher-end design to take care of your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally want to search for a model that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winters. The bright side is that the one major downside of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the cold or exceptionally hot temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise area.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your home.

From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
