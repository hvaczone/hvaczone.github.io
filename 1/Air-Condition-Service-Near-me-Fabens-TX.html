<h3>AC Compressor Repair in Fabens TX 79838</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible hose) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>While these steps will assist to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance items that only a trained HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a sluggish refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause pricey compressor failure, but a property owner does not have the abilities or tools necessary to check refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and proper airflow are vital to a well-functioning system, but homeowners do not have the necessary equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy house owner, it's still required to have a specialist technician check the system periodically.<p>
