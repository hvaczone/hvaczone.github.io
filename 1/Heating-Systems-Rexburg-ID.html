<p>A lot of central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system.

The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning unit works but your home does not cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
