Lastly, the very best times of the year to install a central heater are in the spring and summertime. Because of reduced demand in the warmer months, contractors may be offered to carry out work sooner and possibly at lower rates.

<p>Truth: Federal and local rewards usually total up to between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can typically make the preliminary cost of a system competitive with conventional equipment. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per lots of heating or cooling capability, during brand-new building and construction (homes normally utilize between one and 5 loads). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per ton, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per lot. Nevertheless, new installation practices are reducing costs, to the point where the rate is getting closer to standard systems under the right conditions.<p>

<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act similar to conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most economical. Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the requirement to set up an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
