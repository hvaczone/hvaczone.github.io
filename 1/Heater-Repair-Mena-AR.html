<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
