<p>Central air systems are measured in tons. This measurement is based on the unit's capability to cool your house. For example, a 1 load system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it suggests the amount of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended period of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide should be adjusted frequently, and outdoor measurements utilized for calculations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors might likewise be needed.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air issues by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes emit contaminants.)

Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
