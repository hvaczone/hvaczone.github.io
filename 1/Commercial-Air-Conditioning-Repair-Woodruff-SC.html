<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a relatively simple to measure surrogate for indoor toxins given off by humans, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are unusually high inside your home might cause residents to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to operate at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are generally 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level thought about acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 People are the primary indoor source of co2 in the majority of structures. Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible hose) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
