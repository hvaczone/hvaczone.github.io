<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the cost excellent however Mark went out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the total air flow more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network.

<p>My eldest kid always complained about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a brand-new one.
