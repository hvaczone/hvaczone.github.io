<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning unit back into its original box, utilizing the dense-foam packaging product to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set the box in a cool, dry place for the winter season. And if the storage room has a concrete floor, location two 2x4s beneath the box to raise it up and protect it from wetness.<p>
