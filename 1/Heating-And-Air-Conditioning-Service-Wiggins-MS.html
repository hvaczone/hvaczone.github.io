<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs silently and effectively, however to have 2 significant elements stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the invoice prior to work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<h3>How Does a Heat Pump Work in Wiggins MS?</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was extremely clear and fast about his evaluation, guaranteeing I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>Installation includes digging deep holes or long trenches to set up the pipes, so it's labor-intensive on the front end. Nevertheless, you'll save cash over the long term since of the lower energy costs. Also, a geothermal system tends to last about two times as long as standard air-source units. The absence of moving parts means you're less most likely to spend huge on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be anticipated to last for 50 years. They're significantly more effective then even the highest-efficiency air source units.<p>
