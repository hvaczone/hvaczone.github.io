<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either because of visible growth or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and maintain. Leaking return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you think a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>

<p>Integrity Energy fasted to respond when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our two furnaces were not working. They appeared the next day and replaced 2 heaters and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday up until the brand-new heaters can heat your house.

If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be showing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, offering her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for 7 years, even though it was six months prior to the current one ended. She didn't need a air filtration system, but they talked her into it.<p>
