<h3>Home Air Conditioning Company in Hooksett NH 03106</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
