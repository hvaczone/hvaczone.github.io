<p>We suggest utilizing our insulation boards when setting up over concrete slabs. Warmup Insulation Boards will save you money when utilized in combination with underfloor heating by functioning as a very effective thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the flooring tile instead of enabling heat to heat up the concrete piece below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after switching on your heating, your floor tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more tough to control than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity should be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to minimize mold development.<p>
