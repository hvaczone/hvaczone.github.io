<p>Certain instant effects are similar to those from colds or other viral illness, so it is frequently tough to figure out if the signs are a result of direct exposure to indoor air pollution. For this reason, it is essential to focus on the time and place the symptoms occur. If the signs fade or go away when a person is far from the house and return when the individual returns, an effort must be made to determine indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some impacts may be made worse by an insufficient supply of outdoor air or from the humidity, heating, or cooling conditions common in the house.<p>
