<p>I generally don't leave evaluations however wished to share my experience. You do not expect having to change your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my alternatives. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over alternatives. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household friend and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
