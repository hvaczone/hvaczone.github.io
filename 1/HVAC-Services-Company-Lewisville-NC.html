<p>Radiant heat covers a series of various heating systems, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems operate on comparable principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats up by dispersing hot water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>

<p>Some HVAC technicians offer service contracts to their customers, supplying regular maintenance of heating and cooling systems.

This makes geothermal heating a offered and trustworthy  source of energy.<p>
