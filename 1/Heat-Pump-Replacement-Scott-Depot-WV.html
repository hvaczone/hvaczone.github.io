<p>Central air is a luxury not everybody can afford, many Seattleites need to find ways to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service.

<p>A packaged unit, normally set up on the roofing, is most typically utilized on commercial structures, however it is also a choice for property owners to think about. Oftentimes, these systems contain not just the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those looking to conserve cash on the installation of a new heating and cooling system separately, because the system is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are normally only available for bigger homes due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be a good way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still considerably more pricey than purchasing just a cooling system. Therefore, this might not be the very best alternative for house owners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
