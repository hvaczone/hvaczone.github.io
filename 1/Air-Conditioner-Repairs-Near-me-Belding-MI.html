<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must momentarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
