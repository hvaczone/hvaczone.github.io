<h3>Heat Pump Maintenance in Norton Massachusetts</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine assessment. The tech showed up right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the go to. They recommended replacing a few parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost but a fast internet search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the check out or the new part. I was really happy they stood by their work and repaired the issue. Will certainly be using them once again.<p>

<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take an image of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might require a referral later). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports ought to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've swapped all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
