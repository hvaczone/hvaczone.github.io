The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh makeup air waters down indoor pollutants and assists exhaust them from the house.<p>
