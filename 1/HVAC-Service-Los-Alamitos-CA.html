<p>All Points Heating uses home a/c, a/c installation, air conditioning system maintenance that provide dependable, tested performance at high effectiveness. Combustion products from car exhaust, heating systems, water heaters, area heating systems, fragrant candles, oil lights, wood stoves, fireplaces, and gas ranges that are not properly vented can generate carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and respirable particulates. These combustion products may result in nose, eye, and throat inflammation; fatigue; lightheadedness; and queasiness.<p>
<p>A ducted heatpump appears like a large central air conditioning conditioner system that sits outdoors your home. Heat pumps run on electricity and work like a/c unit in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air.

They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
