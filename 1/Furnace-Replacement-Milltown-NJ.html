<p>EER means Energy Performance Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 Â° F and an indoor temp of 80 Â° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people don't utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>

Like many complex circumstances, there's probably more than one right answer.

You must also have a look at our quality controlled online client ratings and examines area to see what other Seattle homeowners have said about each contractor.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is frequently in the variety of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should temporarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
