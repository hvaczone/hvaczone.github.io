<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should temporarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
