<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall. Because as much as 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leakages in your ducts, a ductless system has an integrated efficiency benefit. Ductless heat pumps are great for additions since they don't need any new ductwork to be set up. Due to the fact that a system is set up in each room or area you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensors that instantly raise the temperature in the space when you are present.<p>
