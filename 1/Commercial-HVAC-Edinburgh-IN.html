<h3>AC Repair Contractor in Edinburgh Indiana</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the home.<p>
<p>Benzene is a recognized human carcinogen. The primary indoor sources of this chemical are ecological tobacco smoke, saved fuels and paint materials, and car emissions in connected garages. Actions that will reduce benzene exposure consist of eliminating smoking within the home, providing for optimum ventilation throughout painting, and discarding paint products and special fuels that will not be used right away.<p>
<p>If your a/c unit is old, consider purchasing an energy-efficient model. Look for the ENERGY STAR ® and EnergyGuide labels - qualified central units have to do with 15% more effective than basic models. New residential central air conditioner requirements went into effect on January 1, 2015; see the efficiency requirements for central air conditioning conditioners for information, and think about buying a system with a higher SEER than the minimum for greater savings.<p>

<p>Sean was extremely useful. He is a very pleasant individual to deal with. No pressure used to purchase additional things. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no issues aside from the blower motor. The only reason he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
