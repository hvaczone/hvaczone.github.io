<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might require a reference in the future). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've swapped all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>

<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 rule however got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

Integrity isn't simply their name, it's a service model they take seriously. You men are formally on speed dial. Talk to you quickly.<p>
