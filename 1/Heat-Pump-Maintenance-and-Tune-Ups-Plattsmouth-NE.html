<p>Right now, millions of allergen, dead skin cells, building and construction debris, and mold may be living in your house's duct, affecting the air you breathe in addition to the efficiency of your heating and cooling system. Indoor air quality isn't on most people's radar.

<p>Truth: Federal and local incentives typically total up to between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can typically make the initial cost of a system competitive with conventional equipment. Requirement air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per lots of heating or cooling capacity, during brand-new building and construction (houses typically use between one and 5 tons). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per heap, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per heap. However, brand-new installation practices are minimizing costs, to the point where the cost is getting closer to standard systems under the right conditions.<p>
