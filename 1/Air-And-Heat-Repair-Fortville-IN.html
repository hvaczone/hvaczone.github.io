<p>It is common to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical material gradually.

Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
