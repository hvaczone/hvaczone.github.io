<p>Central air conditioning units are determined in loads. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 heap unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs.
