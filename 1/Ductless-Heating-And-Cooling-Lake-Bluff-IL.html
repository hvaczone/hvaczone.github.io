<p>I am a real estate investor, I need to change two furnaces in a 8000square foot home. Some sources, such as constructing products, furnishings and items like air fresheners, can release toxins basically continuously. Other sources, related to activities like cigarette smoking, cleaning, refurnishing or doing hobblies launch contaminants periodically. Unvented or malfunctioning devices or poorly utilized products can release higher and in some cases harmful levels of contaminants inside your home.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outside unit as close to the house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>The majority of central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house.
