<p>All homes require reliable ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has actually been burnt out from use. Another possible reason could be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adjusting to the correct temperature level. Heaters that kick on regularly might be due to a dirty filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled and even a dirty burner.<p>
