<h3>Turning to the Right Company for the Right Furnace Repair in Tenafly NJ</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, performed a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy expenses by improving air flow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy efficiency.

In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

<p>I am extremely impressed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call organisation many years earlier and understand the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
