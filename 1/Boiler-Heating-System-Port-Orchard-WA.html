<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to change your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as essential as a regular oil modification in your cars and truck. An unclean filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps contaminants and debris in the air. Once every 3 months, Energy Star advises changing your filter. During high usage months, inspect the filters at least regular monthly.<p>

<h3>Warning Signs That You Need Furnace Repair at Port Orchard WA</h3>
<p>Aspects that can contribute to the growth of biological impurities are wet or damp structure materials (carpeting, ceilings, walls) and poorly maintained humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and ac system. "Humidifier fever" is a typical illness caused by incorrect maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs. Various fungi and germs grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these pollutants can be distributed into the air and inhaled by the building occupants. Other possible sources of biological impurities are family pets and household plants.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that an air conditioning system moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both must be kept clean. This implies that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also required to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually lead to damage to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
