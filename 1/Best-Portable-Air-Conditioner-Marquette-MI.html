Installing a new gas furnace system can be rather expensive if you are including on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>

Sometimes, measured particle levels really increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
