<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

For over 40 years, we have been putting this experience to work for our customers, assisting house owners and companies across the Coastline location repair and set up heating, ventilation, and cooling systems.<p>
<p>Airborne irritants are simply a fact of life. Molds can trigger flare-ups of allergy signs, and sometimes, trigger asthma attacks. Bacteria, viruses, and germs likewise can live in the air you breathe every day. These air-borne contaminants can impact your house comfort equipment, too.

<p>Indoor environments are highly intricate and building residents may be exposed to a variety of pollutants (in the kind of gases and particles) from office makers, cleaning items, building and construction home furnishings, activities and carpets, perfumes, cigarette smoke, water-damaged structure materials, microbial growth (fungal, mold, and bacterial), insects, and outdoor pollutants. Other factors such as indoor temperatures, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also affect how people respond to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture. The goal is to provide adequate modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical component necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
