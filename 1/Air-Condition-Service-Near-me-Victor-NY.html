<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. When I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the price excellent but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high performances, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer season cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

Sometimes, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
