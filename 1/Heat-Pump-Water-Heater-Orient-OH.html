<p>I have actually been operating in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company.

You have a great Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and ought to not "need" to offer you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I give you the options for your needs and you decide if you require it.<p>
