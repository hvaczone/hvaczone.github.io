<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices usually lasts years, since it is secured inside your home. When it does require to be replaced, the expense is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most costly to install.

<p>People working in structures with poor IAQ might see moldy or unpleasant odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy.

Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues.
