The collectors, piping and tank need to be checked for leakages, the system needs to be flushed regularly to remove tank and collected impurities (scaling in tough water areas).

Because it merely takes more electrical power to run a bigger system, a large-scale compressor likewise costs more to operate. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has a chance to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the required moisture. The outcome is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In fact, the room can feel moist and clammy.<p>
