Unvented or malfunctioning devices or improperly utilized products can release higher and sometimes harmful levels of pollutants inside your home.<p>
<p>A regular furnace tune up can maximize efficiency and offer longer lasting house heating. However, there are times when a basic maintenance call can identify an issue that will require a significant investment to fix. Then, it's choice time. Do you make the costly repair and delight in continued convenience from your current heating system? Or, do you make an even bigger monetary commitment to changing the furnace?

<p>Furnaces are like automobiles. As they age, you can replace one part only require another part changed or fixed next year.

<p>Benzene is a recognized human carcinogen. The main indoor sources of this chemical are environmental tobacco smoke, kept fuels and paint materials, and vehicle emissions in connected garages. Actions that will minimize benzene direct exposure consist of removing cigarette smoking within the house, attending to optimum ventilation during painting, and discarding paint supplies and unique fuels that will not be used immediately.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Lowering pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outside) air to dilute contaminated (indoor) air. Local building codes likely specify the amount (and in some cases quality) of outside air that must be continuously provided in your buildings, as do voluntary standards set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Momentarily increasing ventilation paired with appropriate usage of the exhaust system while painting or using pesticides, for example, can be helpful in diluting the concentration of poisonous fumes in the air.<p>
