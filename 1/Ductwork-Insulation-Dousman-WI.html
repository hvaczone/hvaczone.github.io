<p>How environment change impacts air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for contemporary ac system) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioner boost. This increase has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
