<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply 8 to ten years old, it might suck up to two times the electrical power that even a low-end new one would utilize. That's due to the fact that it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to supply a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however nowadays, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling expenses than equipment installed simply a couple of years back.<p>
<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not use auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash coming in every month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to provide auto debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There need to not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>
