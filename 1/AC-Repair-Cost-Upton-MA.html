<p>A/c can likewise be supplied by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
<p>Indoor environments are extremely complicated and building residents may be exposed to a range of impurities (in the kind of particles and gases) from office devices, cleaning products, building carpets, home furnishings and activities, fragrances, cigarette smoke, water-damaged building materials, microbial growth (fungal, mold, and bacterial), insects, and outdoor toxins.
