<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the very same. When the wiring is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Do not put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to appropriately solidify and treat-- usually 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom flooring.<p>
