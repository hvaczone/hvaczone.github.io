<p>Packaged terminal ac system (PTAC) systems are also called wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have two separate systems (terminal packages), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This decreases the interior system footprint and allows each space to be changed individually. PTAC systems may be adjusted to supply heating in cold weather, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, transforming the ac system into a heatpump While room air conditioning provides optimum flexibility, when used to cool numerous spaces at a time it is normally more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>
