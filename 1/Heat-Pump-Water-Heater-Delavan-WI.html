<p>The heatpump gained appeal in the 1950s in Japan and the United States. 12 Heat pumps can draw out heat from different sources, such as environmental air, exhaust air from a building, or from the ground.

<p>Current Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
