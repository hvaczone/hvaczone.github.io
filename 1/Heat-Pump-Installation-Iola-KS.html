<p>This is especially significant, as gas ranges can cause levels of pollution that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with poorly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater.
