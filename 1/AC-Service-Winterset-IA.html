<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pushing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up, do not accept them up until they have been properly dried. If products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent gos to, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
<p>Normally the most reliable method to improve indoor air quality is to get rid of specific sources of pollution or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be adjusted to reduce the quantity of emissions. In a lot of cases, source control is also a more cost-effective approach to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your home are noted later in this section.<p>
