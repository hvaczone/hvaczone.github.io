<p>Lots of commercial structures utilize mechanical ventilation-- fans and ductwork-- that are part of the heating and HVAC systems. Some structures can likewise make use of natural ventilation by opening doors or windows.

<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on.
