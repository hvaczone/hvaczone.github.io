When you do see your furnace acting strangely, it is really important that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as quickly as possible.

<p>First, in terms of benefits, heating the whole home or structure from one unit makes things easier logistically, and the isolation of the heating system from the home is a reward for some property owners.
