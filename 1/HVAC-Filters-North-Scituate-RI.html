<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why spaces heated by radiators are vulnerable to cold spots", implying that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and really hot next to the radiators.

Convected heat offers warmth from the floor up throughout the space without any cold spots or stuffiness in the location being warmed.<p>
<p>The main reason homeowners do not purchase an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 each year, depending on the amount of services offered.
