<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. When I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the cost fantastic but Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my house to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

Their techs are expert and very knowledgeable. Expenses are affordable. Always on time, and call when they are on their way. Waychoff set up a brand-new air handler and condenser this week. I did not bother to get rival's quotes since of my trust in Waychoff because the cost was certainly reasonable.<p>
<p>Room ac system feature a thermostat sensor, situated behind the control board, which measures the temperature level of air entering into the evaporative coil. The air conditioner might cycle constantly or act unpredictably if the sensor is knocked out of position. The sensor needs to be near the coil but not touching it; change its position by carefully flexing the wire that holds it in location.<p>
