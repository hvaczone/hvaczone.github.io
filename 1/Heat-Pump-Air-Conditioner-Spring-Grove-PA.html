<p>Sean was very practical. He is an extremely enjoyable person to deal with. No pressure used to purchase additional things. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no concerns besides the blower motor. The only factor he might not install the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
