<p>The main reason homeowners do not acquire an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 annually, depending upon the amount of services used.

<p>A packaged unit, generally set up on the roofing, is most commonly used on commercial structures, however it is also an alternative for homeowners to think about. Often times, these systems consist of not just the air conditioning system itself however also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is definitely the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those looking to conserve money on the installation of a new cooling and heating system independently, given that the system is combined.
