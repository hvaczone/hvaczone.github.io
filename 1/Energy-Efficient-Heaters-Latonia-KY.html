<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you should inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
