<p>Geothermal heatpump are exceptionally efficient, since ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature level is always at a constant temperature. These systems can attain a geothermal performance of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can only obtain an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Much like other kinds of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal performance rated according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE). POLICE rates just how much heat a system eliminates or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to develop the heating or cooling impact.
