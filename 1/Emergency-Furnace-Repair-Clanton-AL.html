<p>Free cooling systems can have very high effectiveness, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer season air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
