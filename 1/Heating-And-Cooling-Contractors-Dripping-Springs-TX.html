<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not offer auto debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash can be found in every month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to offer car debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
