<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered into force in 2000 and prohibited making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Regulation banned using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid).

<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went excellent. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank.
