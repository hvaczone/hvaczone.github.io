<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid determine the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation.

The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
