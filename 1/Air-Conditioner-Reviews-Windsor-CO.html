Too many folks do not have the needed skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a customer you require to be well informed in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to properly service and the unit has been operating issue free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
