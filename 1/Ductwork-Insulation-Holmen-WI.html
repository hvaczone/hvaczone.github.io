<p>We take a look at hints before we supply advice to replace instead of repair a heating system. One of the clues we look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to usage, or if energy expenses are higher year after year, we understand the system is not running efficiently. It might be in best condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more effective model, then you would be squandering money by not replacing the older unit.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air problems by including brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases produce pollutants.) Nevertheless, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outside air infiltrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas area heater, think about possible effects of indoor air pollution. Follow the producer's directions, specifically directions on the correct fuel and keeping the heating system effectively changed. A relentless yellow-tipped flame is typically a sign of maladjustment and increased toxin emissions. While an area heating system remains in use, open a door from the room where the heating unit is located to the remainder of the house and open a window somewhat.<p>
