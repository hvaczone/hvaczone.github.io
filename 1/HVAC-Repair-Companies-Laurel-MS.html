<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

He also responded to my call right away the next morning, and coached me through a short-term repair to a problem that could not be dealt with on the very first go to due to not available parts. I rely on Nick's skills, experience and ability to deliver constant, quality service.<p>
