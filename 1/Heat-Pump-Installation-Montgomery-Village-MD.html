<p>Today, countless dust mites, dead skin cells, building debris, and mold may be living in your home's air ducts, impacting the air you breathe along with the efficiency of your heating and air conditioning system. Indoor air quality isn't on the majority of people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a danger to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a current study by the Consumer Reports National Research Center.

<p>The first air conditioners and fridges used combustible or hazardous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that might result in deadly mishaps when they dripped.

The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most utilized in direct-expansion home and building convenience cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
