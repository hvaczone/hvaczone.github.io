<h3>Air Conditioner Repair and Maintenance in Towson Maryland</h3>
<p>Typically, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. If your AC unit is wintry, the evaporator coil is most likely frozen. Likewise, if the air conditioning system smells bad, there could be bacteria accumulation on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil soaks up the heat far from your house. It will draw from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to replace the air conditioning unit's evaporator coil.<p>
<p>In a packaged central air conditioning conditioner, the compressor, evaporator, and condenser are all situated in one cabinet, which typically is put on a roof or on a concrete slab beside the house's structure. This kind of a/c also is used in little commercial buildings. Air supply and return ducts originate from indoors through the house's outside wall or roofing system to connect with the packaged a/c, which is usually located outdoors. Packaged air conditioners often consist of electric heating coils or a natural gas furnace. This mix of a/c unit and central heater gets rid of the need for a different furnace inside.<p>

<p>4 Seasons has set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have actually found them to be reasonably priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was necessary and renovated the entire plenum and the duct for the water heater due to the fact that the service technicians believed they just didn't seem ideal and they couldn't leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>

<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes release toxins.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
