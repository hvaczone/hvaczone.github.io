<p>IAQ can be impacted by gases (including carbon monoxide gas, radon, unpredictable organic substances ), particulates, microbial impurities (mold, germs ), or any mass or energy stress factor that can induce unfavorable health conditions. Source control, filtration and the use of ventilation to water down pollutants are the primary techniques for enhancing indoor air quality in many buildings. Residential systems can further enhance indoor air quality by routine cleaning of carpets and area rugs.<p>
<p>Energy performance can be improved even more in central heating systems by presenting zoned heating. This enables a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heating systems.

<p>It might feel cozy being sealed in tight versus the cold in your house during the chillier months of the year, but for individuals who are sensitive to indoor allergens or have respiratory issues, winter can exacerbate issues. Stale indoor air and heating systems can increase the amount of allergy-inducing allergen, family pet dander, and mold spores distributing through your house. In late winter season and early spring, it might still be too cold to toss open the windows to take out the moldy air, so while you await the warmer weather it is essential to be aware of some of the allergic reaction and respiratory triggers that may be hiding in your surroundings.<p>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that you might want to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump systems can have different heating and cooling capabilities.
