<p>IAQ can be impacted by gases (including carbon monoxide gas, radon, unpredictable organic substances ), particulates, microbial impurities (mold, germs ), or any mass or energy stress factor that can induce unfavorable health conditions. Source control, filtration and the use of ventilation to water down pollutants are the primary techniques for enhancing indoor air quality in many buildings.

In late winter season and early spring, it might still be too cold to toss open the windows to take out the moldy air, so while you await the warmer weather it is essential to be aware of some of the allergic reaction and respiratory triggers that may be hiding in your surroundings.<p>
