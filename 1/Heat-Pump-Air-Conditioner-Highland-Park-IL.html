<p>To say there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Location the air conditioning system back into its original box, utilizing the dense-foam packing material to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set package in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, place 2 2x4s beneath package to raise it up and secure it from moisture.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat increases, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the warmth naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head location.
