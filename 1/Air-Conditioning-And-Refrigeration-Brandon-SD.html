Since it merely takes more electrical power to run a larger system, a large-scale compressor likewise costs more to run. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity successfully.

The result is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature shows. In reality, the space can feel clammy and damp.<p>
