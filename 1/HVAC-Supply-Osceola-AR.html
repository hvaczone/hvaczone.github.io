<h3>Forced Air Furnace in Osceola AR 72370</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile tube) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
