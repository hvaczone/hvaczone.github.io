<p>The guidelines that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the same. As soon as the circuitry is total, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Do not put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to appropriately solidify and cure-- usually 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
