<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of breathing infection; there is also evidence from animal studies that duplicated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at particular risk from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and people with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system also may contribute to indoor air quality problems. Ventilation system filters that are not replaced regularly might end up being stopped up, lowering air flow circulation, volume, and quality. They likewise may become places for bacteria and molds to be and grow distributed throughout the home. Humidifier systems on HVAC systems also should be appropriately maintained to prevent germs and mold contamination.<p>
<p>A packaged unit, generally set up on the roof, is most typically used on commercial structures, but it is also a choice for house owners to consider. Many times, these systems contain not just the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged units are great for those seeking to conserve cash on the installation of a new heating & cooling system individually, given that the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these units are usually only available for bigger houses due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be a great way to conserve cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more expensive than buying just a cooling system. Therefore, this might not be the very best alternative for homeowners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>
