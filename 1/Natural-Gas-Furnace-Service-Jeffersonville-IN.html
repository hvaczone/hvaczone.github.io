For instance, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs.

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by building, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in buildings by means of mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) might not be the most pernicious element impacting indoor air quality, however it is frequently used as a surrogate for air quality and building tenancy level. The more occupants there are in a space or building, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from increasing too high-- which can have a negative influence on occupants-- outside air must be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
