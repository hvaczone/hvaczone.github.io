<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, know that there are maintenance products that only an experienced HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can lead to expensive compressor failure, however a house owner does not have the skills or tools necessary to check refrigerant levels.

While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart house owner, it's still required to have an expert technician examine the system regularly.<p>

If one or more of these procedures are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be impacted.<p>
