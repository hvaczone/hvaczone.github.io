<p>All Points Heating uses house a/c, a/c unit installation, air conditioner maintenance that deliver trusted, tested efficiency at high efficiency. Combustion products from auto exhaust, heaters, water heaters, area heaters, aromatic candle lights, oil lights, wood ranges, fireplaces, and gas stoves that are not properly vented can produce carbon monoxide gas, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and respirable particulates. These combustion items might lead to nose, eye, and throat inflammation; fatigue; dizziness; and nausea.<p>
<p>The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and kids can be serious. They consist of hold-ups in mental and physical advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Kids, fetuses, and infants are more vulnerable to lead exposure than adults given that lead is more easily absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more conscious the harmful results of lead. Children might have greater direct exposures because they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>

Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
