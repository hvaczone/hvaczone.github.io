Radon problems in water can be easily repaired. Call your state radon office or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) to learn more.<p>
<p>I am changing our High Velocity System because of a severe refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted devices, a Carrier, Convenience Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise setting up an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding 3 (3) high speed supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will also reuse the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will also install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an option for an extra $2,818.00 to set up a Carrier Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>Allergens are products that cause an immune-type reaction in people who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants found in indoor air are primarily biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these products are little particles, can end up being airborne, and thus, are quickly inhaled. Irritants that are inhaled by sensitized individuals with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For example, if you consider a group of people with asthma, the existence of feline irritant could bring on an asthma attack in individuals with cat allergies, but not in those people who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
<p>Heavy manufacturing markets employ a reasonably little percentage of air conditioning technicians and other HVAC employees, but pay a few of the industry's highest salaries. Electrical power generating companies top the list, with an average wage of $34.09 per hour or $70,920 annually. Automobile parts makers, aerospace producers and car manufacturers are all within a couple of cents of each other at approximately $31 per hour, or over $64,000 annually. Railways are another high-wage company, at approximately $29.33 per hour or $61,000 per year.<p>
