We utilized the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Be sure to view the video first prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets.

Not just will obstructed vents and signs up affect your convenience, they can likewise cause duct leakages due to excessive air pressure and early HVAC repairs and breakdowns. Closing off vents and signs up in unused rooms is NOT an excellent idea. You will not save any money and will end up causing more issues for your heater.<p>
<p>Regularly, indoor air quality issues in big commercial structures can not be efficiently recognized or remedied without an extensive building examination.
