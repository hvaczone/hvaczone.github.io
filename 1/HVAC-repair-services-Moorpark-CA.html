A multi-split system 56 is a traditional split system, which is divided into two parts (evaporator and condenser) and permits cooling or heating of several rooms with one external unit.

Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading out biological contaminants that have actually multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, a/c unit, or the inside surface areas of ventilation duct work.<p>

I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
