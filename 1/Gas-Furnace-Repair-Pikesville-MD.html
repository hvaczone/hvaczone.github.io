<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a reasonably simple to determine surrogate for indoor contaminants discharged by human beings, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are uncommonly high inside your home may cause residents to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to operate at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are normally 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level thought about acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Human beings are the primary indoor source of carbon dioxide in many structures.

<p>When installing a wall sensing unit, think about the height at which they should be put. The majority of commonly they are mounted at height-level or a little lower, if people mainly stay seated in that particular area. Nevertheless, the molecular weight of some compounds makes them gravitate towards the flooring or ceiling; depending upon what contaminant you're trying to track you'll need to place the sensing unit appropriately. For example, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air therefore the greatest concentrations inside structures are typically near the ceiling. On the other hand, ozone is heavier than air and remains near the flooring.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
