<p>As many of you discussed, preventative maintenance is required by all significant equipment maker's to guarantee your factory guarantees remain in place. In addition, the tangible outcomes of a PM is typically hard to quantify, as one reaction stated the cost savings in performance or repairs that were prevented. A lot of pieces of a furnace or air conditioner don't simply break at the breeze of a finger, however rather is the outcome of recurring usage of a part that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon because the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and causing early degeneration, leading to cracks and holes. , if that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and secures the component.. a very helpful result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
