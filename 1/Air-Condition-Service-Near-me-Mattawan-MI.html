<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on. In time, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Before that takes place, you want to get those capacitors altered to avoid additional damage to your system.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it absorbs heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. At the same time, heat is absorbed from inside and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Watch out for signs of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous materials, floor, wall, and ceiling coverings, and furniture found in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to 2 days may become a source for mold development and must be discarded. Sometimes there is a musty odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can thrive in surprise or hardly ever accessed locations of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring products including carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be discovered, chances are there will be mold growing close by. Repair the wetness problem, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly tidy the area utilizing recognized health department recommendations.<p>
