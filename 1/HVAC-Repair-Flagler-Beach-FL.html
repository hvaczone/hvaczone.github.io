<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also switches roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
