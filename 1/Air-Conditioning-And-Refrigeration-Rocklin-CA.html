<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not offer car debit many companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash can be found in monthly, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to provide vehicle debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
