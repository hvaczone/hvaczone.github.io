<p>As noted, improper temperature and humidity levels, and insufficient or too much air circulation may likewise contribute to employee health problems. Temperature levels should vary from 68 degrees - 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels between 30% and 60%. In addition, drafts brought on by too much air flow need to be prevented. Maintenance of proper temperatures and humidity levels and proper air flow will help to lower the occurrence of upper respiratory signs, and, possibly, skin rashes.<p>
<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.<p>
<p>When your house's furnace quits working, your home can have more issues than simply being unpleasant.
