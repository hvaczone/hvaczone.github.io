In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout heat.

The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the incoming air is lowered, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the getting in air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather considerable if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
