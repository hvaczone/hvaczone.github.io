<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. Either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages if your air conditioner is low on refrigerant. Just including refrigerant is not a service if it leaks. A skilled technician must fix any leakage, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the correct amount of refrigerant.

Refrigerant leaks can also be hazardous to the environment.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are constructed.
