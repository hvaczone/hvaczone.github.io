<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts.
