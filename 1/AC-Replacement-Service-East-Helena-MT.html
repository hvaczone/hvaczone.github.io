<p>Buildings are created or meant to react actively to some of these modifications in and around them with heating, cooling, aerating, air cleaning or illuminating systems.

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of solid particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by construction, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in buildings by means of mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
