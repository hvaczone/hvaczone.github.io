Winter season used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to as much as three months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and the people." And not simply with newbies more familiar with AC living. Longtime Seattle property owners are finally giving in, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>
