<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should briefly change back into the routine a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost.
