Since ductwork is so complex, duct cleaning and duct maintenance can seem really daunting initially, requiring specialized tools, devices, and know-how. When you choose Service HQ's duct cleaning services, you won't need to fret about a thing.<p>

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Current Review: They were fantastic! So many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to offer you with the service originally asked for. They fulfilled my needs totally by providing an expert quote with options, without pushing additional products. The crew showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also quickly followed up with the needed inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly suggest this company.<p>
