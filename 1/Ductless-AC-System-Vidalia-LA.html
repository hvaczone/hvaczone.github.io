<p>There is a transformer in your a/c furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer breakdowns, your Nest won't begin. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety changes that safeguard your air conditioning system from flooding. Among the most common locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a good chance; you may have a water leakage in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen. The water activates your emergency safety switch, therefore cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts off all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have actually seen baseplate spoil on uncommon events.<p>
