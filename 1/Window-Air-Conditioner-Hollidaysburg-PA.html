<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to locate the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head location. All things in the hot zone reach balance in temperature level after the convected heat system has been running for a while, including people. When the furnace kicks in and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

We want you to get the most out of your current system as long as it makes good sense for you and your family.<p>
<p>Air flow patterns in structure are identified by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural results. Atmospheric pressure differences created by these forces move air-borne toxins from locations of greater pressure to areas of lower pressure through any readily available opening in structure walls, ceilings, floorings, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is small, air will move till the within pressure is equal to the outside.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, implying they utilize air to exchange heat, in the very same method as a car radiator or common home air conditioning system does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It gathers water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which needs to be vented outside the cooled location; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outdoors air.<p>

<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it takes in heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. While doing so, heat is soaked up from inside and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
