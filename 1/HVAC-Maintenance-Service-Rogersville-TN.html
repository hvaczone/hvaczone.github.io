<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of direct exposure is through the production of an aerosol result, most commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from improperly placed or kept evaporative cooling towers, which often launch water in an aerosol which may enter nearby ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical facilities and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis.

The presence of Legionella in commercial building water products is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals need heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
