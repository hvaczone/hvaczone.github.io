<h3>Get Your HVAC System Serviced Annually in Bonaire GA</h3>
<p>All contemporary cooling systems, even little window plan systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or cleaned as conditions necessitate. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. In addition, extremely unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>

A professional maintenance technician will flush and clean up the condensate drain to guarantee all excess moisture streams away from the system.<p>
