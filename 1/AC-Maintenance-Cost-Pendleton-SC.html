<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
