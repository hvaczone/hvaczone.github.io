<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Filthy filters are the most common reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your house will not warm up. Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A filthy filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
