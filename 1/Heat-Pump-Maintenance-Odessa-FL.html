<p>Heaters resemble cars and trucks. As they age, you can change one part only need another part changed or fixed next year. It does not take long to invest $500 simply to keep an old oil or gas furnace running. Heating systems incur the most breakdowns in the last 2 years of their lives. Another repair indication is whether you needed to wait to get parts changed. As a furnace ages, it gets harder to source replacement parts. Waiting that can be actually cold on a below zero night.<p>
