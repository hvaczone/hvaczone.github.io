<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace technicians often find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC refrigerators illegal. 30 DuPont and other companies blocked the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the approach as "that German technology". 29 31 Nonetheless, in 2004, Greenpeace dealt with international corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later Pepsico and others, to create a corporate coalition called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, four years later on, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric began to take steps to support production and use in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA chose in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-134a, r-410a and r-404a are, since 2020, being replaced with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and cooling, R-1234yf in vehicles, R-32 in residential a/c and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration. R-600 (isobutane) is already extensively utilized in residential refrigeration.<p>
