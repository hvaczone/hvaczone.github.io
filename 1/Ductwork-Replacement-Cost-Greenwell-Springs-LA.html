<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outside - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heating systems are still commonly utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>There are many things to consider when trying to determine how frequently I ought to change my air conditioning filters.
