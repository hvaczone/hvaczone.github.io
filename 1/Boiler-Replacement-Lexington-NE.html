Breathing air contaminants can result in asthmatic and allergic responses, infections and other health issue that involve the lungs, nose and throat.

Secondhand smoke is also harmful to people, particularly kids.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are developed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odor-free, radioactive gas. Radon gas goes into homes through dirt floors, cracks in concrete walls and floorings, flooring drains pipes, and sumps. When radon ends up being trapped in concentrations and structures build up inside your home, exposure to radon becomes a concern.<p>

Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
