Others were nearly two times the amount Protex priced estimate for low end off brand devices. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The set up group was respectful of my house and set up the devices in the anticipated quantity of time. post set up examination outcomes look excellent for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools far better than the 13 years of age 4 load R22 unit it changed (also Carrier).<p>
