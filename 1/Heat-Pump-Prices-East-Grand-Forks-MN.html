The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system.

Using existing ductwork will remove the requirement to install an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based.

Portable instruments utilized to measure carbon dioxide should be adjusted often, and outside measurements utilized for estimations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors might also be necessary.<p>
