<p>I typically do not leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my alternatives. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss alternatives. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>
