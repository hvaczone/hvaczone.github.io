<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones, the primary problem. While installing a separate split system, workers try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system develops more troubles, since some of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the a/c separately for each space. However, now the marketplace has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>
