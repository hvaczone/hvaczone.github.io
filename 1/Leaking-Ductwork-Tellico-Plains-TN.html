<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in every month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to provide vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There need to not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
