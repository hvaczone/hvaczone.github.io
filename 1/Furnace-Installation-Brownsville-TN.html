<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you ought to inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
