<p>Recognized as a leader in the HVAC industry, Bard Production combines quality items and impressive service with innovation and technological advances to deliver high-performance heating & cooling products around the world. A multi-split system 56 is a conventional split system, which is divided into 2 parts (evaporator and condenser) and enables cooling or heating of a number of spaces with one external system. In the outside system of this a/c unit there is a more effective compressor, ports for linking several traces and automation with locking valves for controling the volume of refrigerant provided to the indoor systems found in the room.<p>
<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were very popular in the very first half of the 20th century, especially in commercial buildings, apartment buildings and huge homes. Many steam and radiator boiler systems installed more than 50 years ago stay operable, since the absence of moving parts makes them less vulnerable to tear and use. A steam boiler replacement costs between $4,000 and $30,000, depending on boiler size.<p>
