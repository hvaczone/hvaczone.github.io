<p>The majority of central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the ac system works but your house doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>

If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
