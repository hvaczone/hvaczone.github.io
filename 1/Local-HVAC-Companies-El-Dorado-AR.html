<h3>Gas Central Heating Systems at El Dorado AR - The Benefits</h3>
<p>All modern a/c systems, even little window package units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be changed or cleaned as conditions necessitate. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will need to have the filters altered more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Additionally, really dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>

Expect to service your furnace yearly at a cost of around $200, alter your filters every 1 - 3 months, and clean your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running optimally.<p>
