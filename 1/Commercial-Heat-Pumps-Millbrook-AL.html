<h3>AC Technician in Millbrook Alabama</h3>
<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump.

An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the invoice prior to work started. Parts were covered by guarantee.
