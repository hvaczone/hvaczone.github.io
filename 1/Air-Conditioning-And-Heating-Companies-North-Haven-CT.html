<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady gradually. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product with time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
