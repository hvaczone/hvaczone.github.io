<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
