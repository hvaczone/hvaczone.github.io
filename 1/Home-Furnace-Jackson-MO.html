These systems can achieve a geothermal performance of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can only obtain a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Just like other types of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal efficiency ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE). POLICE OFFICER rates how much heat a system removes or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to develop the heating or cooling effect. The majority of ground source heatpump have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this means is that for every unit of energy used by a geothermal heat pump, roughly 3 to 5 units are supplied back in the type of heat.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
