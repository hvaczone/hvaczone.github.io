<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>

<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically described as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heatpump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise changes roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
