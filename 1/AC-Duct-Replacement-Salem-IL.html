A multi-split system 56 is a conventional split system, which is divided into 2 parts (evaporator and condenser) and allows cooling or heating of a number of spaces with one external unit.

The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

If that client had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and secures the component.  a very advantageous result and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that possibly conserved a client thousands.<p>
