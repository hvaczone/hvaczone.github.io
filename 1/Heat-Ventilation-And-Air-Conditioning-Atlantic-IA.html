<p>You're encouraging the development of mold in wet air if you set it too low. The heat dries out the air, avoiding mold development and contamination. Naturally, too-dry air can also aggravate your lungs and sinuses, while too much indoor humidity can contribute to the development of bacteria and viruses, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health.
