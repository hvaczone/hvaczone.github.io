<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones, the primary issue. While setting up a different split system, employees attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system develops more troubles, given that a few of indoor systems can be situated far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the cooling individually for each space. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor systems run individually from each other.<p>
