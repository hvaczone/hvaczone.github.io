<p>In homes, the most considerable sources of formaldehyde are likely to be pressed wood products used adhesives that contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pressed wood products made for indoor use include: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in cabinets and furniture); wood plywood paneling (utilized for decorative wall covering and utilized in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiberboard (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops). Medium density fiber board consists of a higher resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pushed wood item and is usually recognized as being the highest formaldehyde-emitting pressed wood product.<p>
<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was extremely valuable in collecting details on the phone and offering clear instructions about how to briefly handle the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and used clear interaction about the problem, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will absolutely utilize Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and home.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: They were great! So many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service initially requested.

The crew appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and completed a little early. The also without delay followed up with the needed inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely advise this company.<p>
