<p>The contaminants noted in this guide have been shown to cause the health effects discussed. However, it is not always real that the impacts noted occur at the pollutant concentration levels typically discovered in the house. In many cases, our understanding of the pollutants and their health impacts is too minimal to figure out the levels at which the listed results might occur.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air issues by adding brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases discharge toxins.) However, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
