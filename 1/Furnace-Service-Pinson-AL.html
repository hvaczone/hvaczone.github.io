Unvented or malfunctioning home appliances or improperly used products can release greater and sometimes unsafe levels of pollutants indoors.<p>
<p>A/c unit makers typically make rugged, high quality items. Start by checking any fuses or circuit breakers if your air conditioner stops working. Let the unit cool off for about five minutes prior to resetting any breakers.
