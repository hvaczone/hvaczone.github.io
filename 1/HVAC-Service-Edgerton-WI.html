<p>As a lot of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment manufacturer's to guarantee your factory warranties remain in location. Moreover, the tangible results of a PM is typically difficult to quantify, as one action mentioned the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented. Many pieces of a furnace or air conditioning unit do not simply break at the snap of a finger, however instead is the result of repeated use of a component that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger might fail too soon because the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and triggering early degeneration, resulting in fractures and holes. , if that client had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the element.. a very beneficial outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>
