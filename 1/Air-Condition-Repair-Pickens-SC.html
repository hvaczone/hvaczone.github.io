While installing a different split system, workers attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little.

The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the cooling separately for each space. However, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor systems operate separately from each other.<p>
