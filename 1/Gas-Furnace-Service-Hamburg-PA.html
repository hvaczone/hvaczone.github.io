<h3>Maximizing the Performance of Your HVAC System in Hamburg PA</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Both must be kept tidy since an air conditioner moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outside coil. This indicates that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise necessary to routinely clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
