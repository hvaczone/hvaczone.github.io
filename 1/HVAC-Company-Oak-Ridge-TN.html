<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Regulation banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that equipment that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>

<p>Recent Review: They were great! So many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to offer you with the service initially requested. They satisfied my needs completely by supplying a professional quote with options, without pressing additional items. The team appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also quickly followed up with the necessary assessments from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely advise this company.<p>
<p>The steadiness of the market's development doesn't always translate to the experience of operating an HVAC company. The ventilation, heating and air conditioning business tends to run cold and hot. Demand warms up during the summer season and winter when customers need their HVAC systems fixed for relief versus the cold and heat; service calls drop off when milder weather gets here.<p>
