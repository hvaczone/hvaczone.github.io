<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outdoor system as close to your house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
