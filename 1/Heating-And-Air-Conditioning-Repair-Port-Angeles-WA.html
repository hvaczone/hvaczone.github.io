<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets ask for consultation and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation measure. Nevertheless, a number of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned routinely, they can end up being obstructed with debris that can limit airflow, possibly impacting your convenience and your system's effectiveness. Dirty filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace components and in more extreme cases trigger the system to close down entirely. By contrast, checking and replacing a furnace filter can normally be done in simply a few minutes, frequently without any tools required. As a precaution, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
