<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a photo of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might require a reference later). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Remove the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've switched all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>

<p>It's on days like these that the idea of an in-floor heater appears less like a luxury product and more like a necessity.
