<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning unit works but the house does not cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
