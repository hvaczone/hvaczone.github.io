<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
