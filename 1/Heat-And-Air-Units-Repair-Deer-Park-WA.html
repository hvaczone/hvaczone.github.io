<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones, the primary issue. While setting up a separate split system, employees try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system develops more troubles, considering that a few of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. However, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor systems run individually from each other.<p>
