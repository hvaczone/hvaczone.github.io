<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
