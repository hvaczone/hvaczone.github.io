<p>Specialist heating unit setups. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heating unit will eventually stop working. HVAC experts advise following this basic rule when deciding whether it deserves purchasing a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost more than half the rate of a brand-new system, it's best to purchase brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have many more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than required.<p>
