<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise switches roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>Advanced ventilation systems that make it possible for higher air flow from the outdoors, air quality tracking platforms and sensors, and brand-new air filtration innovations are becoming more typical as readily available services in residential and commercial HVAC item bundles. Adoption of these technologies, however, has actually not been prevalent, as customers remain mostly oblivious to the results of air quality on health and performance.<p>
