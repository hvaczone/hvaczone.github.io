<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outside unit as near to the house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely experienced of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>
<p>The cost for heat pump installation also depends upon the size of the system and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system. A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, including installation. Whole-house systems, on the other hand, variety in cost from $2,500 to $7,500, including installation. Geothermal heat pumps typically require excavation to set up, which adds a number of thousand dollars to the cost.<p>

If a source of water or condensation can be found, opportunities exist will be mold growing nearby. Fix the wetness issue, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Completely tidy the location utilizing recognized health department recommendations.<p>
