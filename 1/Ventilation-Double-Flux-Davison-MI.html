<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his staff members, devices expenses, marketing, energies, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not sound like much, specifically if the objective of owning a service was for monetary freedom. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it took to construct business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% usually isn't the end objective. HVAC business owners must strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their profits while keeping costs the same in all other locations.<p>

If it blows once again, call a pro-- you've got more severe concerns.<p>
