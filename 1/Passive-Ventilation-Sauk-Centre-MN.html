Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
