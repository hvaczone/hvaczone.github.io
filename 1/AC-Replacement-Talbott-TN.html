As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
