<p>Free cooling systems can have very high effectiveness, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
