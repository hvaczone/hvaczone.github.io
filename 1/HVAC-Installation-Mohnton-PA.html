<p>A packaged unit, generally installed on the roof, is most frequently used on commercial structures, however it is also a choice for homeowners to consider. Oftentimes, these systems consist of not only the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are terrific for those aiming to conserve money on the installation of a new cooling and heating system independently, since the system is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are normally only readily available for larger homes due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be a great way to save cash on a total HVAC system, they're still considerably more costly than buying simply a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the very best option for homeowners looking for short-term cost savings or those with smaller spending plans.<p>
