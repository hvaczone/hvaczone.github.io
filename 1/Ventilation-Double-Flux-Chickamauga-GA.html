<p>A geothermal desuperheater is really effective and helpful, particularly during the Summertime while the system acts to cool one's home. This is due to the fact that the excess heat absorbed from within the house is conducted into the hot water tank instead of being sent back into the earth. The outcome, for that reason, is complimentary warm water!

<p>During winter, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, sending the taken in heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>
