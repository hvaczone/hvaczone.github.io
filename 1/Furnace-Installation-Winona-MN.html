What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my choices. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about options. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>
<p>. Prior to selecting the installation area of air conditioner, a number of main factors need to be thought about. Firstly, the direction of air circulation from the indoor units must not fall on the location of rest or work area.
