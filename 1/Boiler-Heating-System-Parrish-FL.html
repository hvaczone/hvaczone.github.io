<p>The guidelines that included the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the very same. Once the wiring is total, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable warms. Do not put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly solidify and treat-- usually 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom floor.<p>
