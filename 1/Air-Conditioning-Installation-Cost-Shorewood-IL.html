<p>Central air conditioning units are determined in tons. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your house. For example, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 load system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it indicates the amount of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>

Seattle might be the last city in the nation to deal with the reality of a cruel, cruel summertime.<p>
