When used in combination with underfloor heating by acting as a very effective thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you money. They reflects the heat upwards into the floor tile instead of enabling heat to warm up the concrete slab below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after turning on your heating, your flooring tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
