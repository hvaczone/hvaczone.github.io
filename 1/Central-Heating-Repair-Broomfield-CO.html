<p>Your heating, air, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a variety of pollutants that have the potential to negatively impact your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungi, germs, and really little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor must evaluate and, if required, upgrade the building envelope. For instance, he may seal spaces and fractures in the outer walls and attic flooring, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling costs. Insulation might be a more reliable solution to your cooling issues than replacing your equipment.<p>

Energy Environmental Corporation is experienced in geothermal heat pump installation and can help you appropriately size a system.<p>
