<p>Most central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the ac system works but the house does not cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
