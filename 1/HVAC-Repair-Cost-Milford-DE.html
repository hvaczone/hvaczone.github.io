<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might need a referral later). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4).

The female crimp connectors must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Eliminate the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually swapped all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
