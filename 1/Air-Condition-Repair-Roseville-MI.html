<p>The quality of the air inside our homes, workplaces and schools matters, especially since we invest the majority of our lives indoors. Ac system help to dehumidify the inbound air, but in exceptionally humid environments or in cases where the air conditioner is oversized, it may not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the ac system will need more energy to cool your home. A preferable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be added as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned frequently, they can become clogged with debris that can restrict airflow, possibly affecting your comfort and your system's performance. Filthy filters can trigger additional wear and tear on furnace components and in more severe cases trigger the system to close down totally. By contrast, changing a furnace and examining filter can normally be carried out in simply a couple of minutes, often with no tools required. As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
