Refrigerant leaks can also be hazardous to the environment.<p>

<p>EER represents Energy Performance Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air units is determined by the variety of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people don't utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you must inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
