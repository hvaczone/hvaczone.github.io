He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call company several years earlier and understand the importance of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
