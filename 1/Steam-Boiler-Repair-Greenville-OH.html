<p>Aspects that can add to the development of biological contaminants are damp or wet building materials (carpets, ceilings, walls) and poorly maintained humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioners. "Humidifier fever" is a typical illness brought on by incorrect maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and persistent coughs.
