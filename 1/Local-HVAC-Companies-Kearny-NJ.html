<p>Some health impacts might show up soon after a single direct exposure or repeated exposures to a toxin. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and tiredness. Such instant impacts are normally short-term and treatable. Sometimes the treatment is simply eliminating the person's exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be identified.

<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to change your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as vital as a routine oil modification in your vehicle. An unclean filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps pollutants and particles in the air. Once every 3 months, Energy Star suggests changing your filter. During high use months, check the filters at least regular monthly.<p>
