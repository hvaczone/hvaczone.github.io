<h3>HVAC Repair Companies in Starke Florida</h3>
<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either because of noticeable development or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and check. Dripping return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you presume a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
