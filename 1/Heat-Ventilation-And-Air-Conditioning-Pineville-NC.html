<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summer season. These convection heaters are still extensively utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>If you work in building and construction, demolition, painting, with batteries, in a radiator service center or lead factory, or your hobby involves lead, you may unknowingly bring lead into your house on your hands or clothing. You may also be tracking in lead from soil around your home. Soil very close to homes may be polluted from lead paint on the outside of the structure. Soil by highways and roads might be polluted from years of exhaust fumes from cars and trucks that used leaded gas. Usage door mats to clean your feet before entering the house. If you deal with lead in your job or a hobby, alter your clothes prior to you go house and wash these clothing separately. Encourage your children to play in sand and grassy locations rather of dirt which stays with toys and fingers. Try to keep your children from eating dirt, and make certain they wash their hands when they come inside.<p>
