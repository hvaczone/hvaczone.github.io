<p>My oldest kid always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I understood that it actually didnâ $ t disperse air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually consider anything else except replacing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The noise level is itâ and low $ s excellent on energy saving too.<p>
