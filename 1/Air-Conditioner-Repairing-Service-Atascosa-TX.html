<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>The quality of the air inside our workplaces, schools and homes matters, especially considering that we invest the majority of our lives indoors. Air conditioners help to dehumidify the inbound air, however in incredibly humid environments or in cases where the a/c is oversized, it may not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the air conditioning system will need more energy to cool your home. A more suitable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
<p>For example, problems occur when, in an effort to conserve energy, ventilation systems are not used to generate sufficient quantities of outside air.

Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading biological contaminants that have actually multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, ac system, or the inside surface areas of ventilation duct.<p>
