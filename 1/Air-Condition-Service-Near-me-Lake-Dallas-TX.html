<p>A packaged unit, generally set up on the roof, is most frequently utilized on commercial structures, however it is also an alternative for house owners to consider. Often times, these units consist of not only the air conditioning system itself however also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is definitely the cost. Packaged units are fantastic for those wanting to save cash on the installation of a new cooling and heating system separately, given that the system is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are normally just available for bigger homes due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be a good way to conserve money on a total HVAC system, they're still significantly more costly than buying just a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the very best alternative for house owners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized spending plans.<p>
