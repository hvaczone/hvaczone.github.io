<p>WE ARE ALSO USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the conventional hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the standard hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the water pipe leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be shut off entirely.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most common cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your house will not warm up. Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. An unclean filter likewise causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, decreasing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
