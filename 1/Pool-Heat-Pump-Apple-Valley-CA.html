<p>The pollutants listed in this guide have been shown to cause the health results discussed. Nevertheless, it is not necessarily real that the impacts noted occur at the pollutant concentration levels usually discovered in the home. In a lot of cases, our understanding of the toxins and their health effects is too limited to identify the levels at which the listed results might occur.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by including brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often emit toxins.) Nevertheless, measures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Watch out for signs of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous products, floor, wall, and ceiling coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have actually been damp for over 24 to 48 hours might end up being a source for mold development and should be disposed of. Often there is a musty smell however mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can flourish in surprise or seldom accessed locations of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring products including carpet underpadding. Possibilities are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Repair the wetness issue, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Completely tidy the area using recognized health department suggestions.<p>
