<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heating systems are still widely utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."
