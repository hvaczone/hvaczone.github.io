<p>This was without a doubt the very best and most satisfying service me and my partner have ever received. Firstly the specialists shown up here precisely when they said that they would. Their prices was directly in line with the level of service that was offered as well, the technicians discussed exactly what they were doing and looking for every single step of the method while they were here. They also helped us set up a specific service plan that in the long run will help us conserve cash.<p>
<p>I am really impressed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation several years earlier and know the value of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also amazed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>The predominant health impact related to exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might position threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your danger of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
