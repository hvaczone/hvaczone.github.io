Additionally, the tangible outcomes of a PM is frequently hard to quantify, as one response mentioned the savings in efficiency or repairs that were prevented. Many pieces of a furnace or a/c do not just break at the breeze of a finger, but instead is the outcome of repetitive use of a part that runs out balance.

If that client had received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the part.  an extremely advantageous result and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a client thousands.<p>
