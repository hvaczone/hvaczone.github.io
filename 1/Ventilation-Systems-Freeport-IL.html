<p>RMI is working to alter that, starting in California. As a first step, in April RMI affirmed prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set stronger indoor guidelines based upon the most current science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to manage indoor devices through codes, and after stronger guidelines are set there is an opportunity to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>
