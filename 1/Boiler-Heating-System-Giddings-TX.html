<p>At present, EPA does not recommend using air cleaners to reduce levels of radon and its decay products. The efficiency of these gadgets doubts because they only partly remove the radon decay items and do not reduce the quantity of radon entering the house. EPA prepares to do extra research on whether air cleaners are, or might end up being, a reputable means of decreasing the health danger from radon. EPA's pamphlet, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, offers more information on air-cleaning devices to reduce indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>This is particularly notable, as gas stoves can trigger levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with inadequately changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>Some biological contaminants set off allergic reactions, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some types of asthma. Contagious health problems, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are sent through the air. Molds and mildews launch disease-causing toxic substances. Signs of illness caused by biological pollutants include sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, dizziness, lethargy, fever, and digestive problems.<p>
