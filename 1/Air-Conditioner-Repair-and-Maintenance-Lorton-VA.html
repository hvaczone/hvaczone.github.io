<h3>Truth That You May Not Know About a Boiler Heating System in Lorton VA</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transferring the soaked up heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression procedure. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>
