<p>Central air systems are measured in lots. This measurement is based on the unit's capability to cool your home. For example, a 1 lot system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 heap unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it implies the quantity of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
