Installation charges differ throughout the county, but begin at approximately $50 per hour approximately $150 or more. It takes roughly five hours to install a small furnace and more to install a big one.<p>
<p>G&S did an exceptional task installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The best feature of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Producers warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Also they detected the issue and fixed extremely quickly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
