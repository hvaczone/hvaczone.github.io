<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
