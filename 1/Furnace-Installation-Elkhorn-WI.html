<p>Today's home convected heat systems take full advantage of infrared radiation. By far, the most common source of a radiator in a home is the flooring mass. Radiators can be locally located in one location like a restroom flooring or be installed across the whole sub-surface of the house's floorings.

<p>. Before selecting the installation location of air conditioner, numerous main factors require to be thought about. Firstly, the direction of air circulation from the indoor systems should not fall on the location of rest or workspace. Secondly, there need to not be any obstacles en route of the air flow that may prevent it from covering the space of the facilities as much as possible.

It is highly recommended to set up the air conditioning system systems in easily accessible locations, for more maintenance during operation.<p>
