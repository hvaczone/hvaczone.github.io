<p>Both need to be kept clean due to the fact that an air conditioner moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil. This means that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately result in harm to the compressor, since the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
