<p>The first ac system and refrigerators employed hazardous or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that might result in fatal accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<h3>Maximizing the Performance of Your HVAC System in Mckinleyville CA</h3>
<p>A routine furnace tune up can go a long way towards decreasing a number of the concerns brought on by build-up of dirt and debris, and the inspections enable your contractor to keep an eye on longer-term issues and take proactive actions to help avoid early failure or inconvenient breakdowns throughout the heating season.

Lots of producers state on guarantee paperwork that installation and maintenance by a licensed HVAC service provider are a part of the guarantee conditions.
