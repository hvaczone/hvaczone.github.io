<p>I am very impressed with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company several years back and know the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise impressed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year.

<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heating unit, think about prospective results of indoor air pollution. Follow the maker's instructions, particularly directions on the correct fuel and keeping the heating unit appropriately changed. A relentless yellow-tipped flame is generally a sign of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While an area heater is in use, open a door from the room where the heating unit is located to the rest of the home and open a window slightly.<p>
