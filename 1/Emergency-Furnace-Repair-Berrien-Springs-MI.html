<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help determine the efficiency of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation.

The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
