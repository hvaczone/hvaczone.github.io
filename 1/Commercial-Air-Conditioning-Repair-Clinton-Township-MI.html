<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation.

When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine components. To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator requires handled by experts, check out Eric's Garage today.<p>
<p>When it comes to heated water or steam, piping is used to transport the heat to the spaces.

The radiators might be installed on walls or installed within the floor to produce floor heat.<p>
