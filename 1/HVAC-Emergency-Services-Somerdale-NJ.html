<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his staff members, equipment expenses, marketing, utilities, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, especially if the goal of owning an organisation was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it required to develop the business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% usually isn't the end objective.

This suggests that equipment that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
