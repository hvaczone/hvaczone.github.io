<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to find a place that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Since it exhausts warm air out the top, do not put the condenser under a deck or totally confine it. Any air flow constraint will decrease the unit's effectiveness. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely distribute around it.<p>

<p>A packaged unit, normally installed on the roofing system, is most typically used on commercial structures, however it is likewise a choice for property owners to think about. Many times, these systems include not just the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged systems are fantastic for those looking to save money on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system separately, given that the system is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are typically only readily available for bigger homes due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be a good way to save cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still considerably more costly than purchasing simply a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the very best option for property owners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
