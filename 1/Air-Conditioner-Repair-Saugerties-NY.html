<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. When I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the rate great however Mark headed out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was extremely handy in gathering details on the phone and providing clear guidelines about how to temporarily handle the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and used clear communication about the problem, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will definitely use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for office and house.<p>
