<h3>Central Heating Installation Agency in Jupiter FL</h3>
<p>Another approach to lowering the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your home is to increase the quantity of outside air coming indoors. A lot of home heating and cooling systems, including required air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening windows and doors, running window or attic fans, when the weather condition permits, or running a window air conditioning system with the vent control open boosts the outside ventilation rate. Local restroom or kitchen fans that exhaust outdoors remove contaminants straight from the room where the fan is located and also increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
