While installing a separate split system, employees attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system develops more difficulties, since some of indoor systems can be located far from the outside.

Nevertheless, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor systems operate individually from each other.<p>

Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors develops the requirement for careful attention to humidity levels indoors.
