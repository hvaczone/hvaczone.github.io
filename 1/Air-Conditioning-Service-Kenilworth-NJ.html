However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
