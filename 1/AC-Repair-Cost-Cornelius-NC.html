<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the automobile debit, although my company does not use auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash coming in on a monthly basis, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year.
