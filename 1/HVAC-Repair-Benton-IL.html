<p>Since an a/c unit moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both need to be kept tidy. This suggests that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to routinely clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually result in damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

<p>You're encouraging the development of mold in moist air if you set it too low. The heat dries out the air, preventing mold growth and pollution. Naturally, too-dry air can also irritate your sinuses and lungs, while excessive indoor humidity can add to the development of bacteria and viruses, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Health and Environmental Health. The perfect humidity in a house is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>Great service within 24 hr and a fair cost. The technician (Camryn) was really thorough and on-time in describing what services would be performed.

<p>Please schedule an appointment for a medical evaluation at the University Employee Occupational Health Clinic by calling 919-966-9119 if you believe there is a health issue associated to the indoor environment.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should momentarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
