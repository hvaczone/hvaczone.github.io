Structures continuously develop as an outcome of the changes in the environment around them in addition to the residents, products, and activities within them. The various surfaces and the air inside a building are constantly engaging, and this interaction leads to changes in each. For example, we might see a window as altering somewhat in time as it becomes unclean, then is cleaned, accumulates dirt once again, is cleaned once again, and so on through its life. In reality, the dirt" we see might be progressing as a result of the interactions among the wetness, chemicals, and biological products discovered there.<p>
<p>For instance, problems emerge when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not utilized to generate adequate quantities of outdoor air.

Poorly situated outside air intake vents can likewise bring in air polluted with automobile and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from restrooms. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading biological pollutants that have actually increased in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, ac system, or the within surface areas of ventilation duct work.<p>
