<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. If your a/c unit is short on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. If it leaks, simply adding refrigerant is not a service. An experienced technician should fix any leakage, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the appropriate amount of refrigerant. Bear in mind that the performance and effectiveness of your air conditioning system is greatest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the manufacturer's specification, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leakages can likewise be hazardous to the environment.<p>
<p>There are lots of things to take into consideration when trying to determine how often I should change my cooling filters. Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 house has a special DNA on how it builds up dust and dirt. It takes about six months of close observation to see how frequently your cooling filter gathers dirt and dust. After that, you can make a much better ideal choice on how often your HVAC filters need replacing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 homes have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 home, the less often you'll have to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 houses with only one a/c filter require changing more frequently.<p>
