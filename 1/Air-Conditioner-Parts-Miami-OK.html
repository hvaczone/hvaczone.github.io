These systems can obtain a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heatpump can only achieve a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Just like other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal efficiency ranked according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE OFFICER). COP rates how much heat a system produces or gets rid of (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to create the heating or cooling effect.
