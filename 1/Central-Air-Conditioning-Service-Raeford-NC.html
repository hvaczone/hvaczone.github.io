<p>EER stands for Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning units is measured by the variety of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a conventional system of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.

<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to protect the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. Nevertheless, pick your contractor carefully, many of the 'respectable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales strategies that DO take advantage of uninformed house owners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line indicator that you MIGHT be working with a reputable company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable ranking are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>As much of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment maker's to guarantee your factory service warranties remain in place. Furthermore, the concrete outcomes of a PM is frequently tough to quantify, as one action mentioned the savings in efficiency or repairs that were avoided. Most pieces of a furnace or a/c unit do not simply break at the breeze of a finger, however rather is the result of repetitive usage of a part that runs out balance. For instance, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon since the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and causing premature degeneration, resulting in holes and cracks. If that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and protects the component.  a really useful outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a client thousands.<p>
