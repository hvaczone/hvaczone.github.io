So maybe a little steep on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>

<p>Make sure there are no carpets, furniture, or anything else limiting the circulation of air. Not only will obstructed vents and registers impact your convenience, they can also cause duct leaks due to excessive atmospheric pressure and early HVAC repairs and breakdowns. Closing off vents and registers in unused rooms is NOT a good idea. You won't conserve any extra money and will end up causing more problems for your heating system.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
