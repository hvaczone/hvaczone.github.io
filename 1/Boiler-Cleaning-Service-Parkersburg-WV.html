<p>Your heating, air, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a variety of contaminants that have the prospective to adversely impact your health-- contaminants such as mold, fungi, germs, and very little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor must evaluate and, if necessary, upgrade the building envelope. For example, he may seal gaps and fractures in the external walls and attic floor, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your cooling and heating expenses. Insulation might be a more effective solution to your cooling problems than replacing your equipment.<p>
