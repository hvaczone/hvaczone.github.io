Where a geothermal HVAC taps into the heat inside the earth for space heating, cooling or for heating one's water system, geothermal energy is the procedure by which the heat inside the earth is used for creating power in the type of electrical energy. The 2 operations use different processes, with geothermal energy needing water be heated to boiling point to achieve its aims.<p>
