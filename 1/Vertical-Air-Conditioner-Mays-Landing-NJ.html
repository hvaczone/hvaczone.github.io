<p>There are numerous reasons that this can occur. The bright side is that you can deal with a lot of these elements by yourself without the need to call for professional help.

You can likewise check the filter to ensure it is clear of dirt and inspect the standing pilot burner to make sure it is lit.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a pipe two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your home.

During use, there is a dead time while heat is being transported from the heating unit to the living space.<p>
