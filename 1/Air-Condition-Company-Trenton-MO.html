<p>We look at clues before we offer guidance to change instead of repair a heater. Among the clues we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to use, or if energy bills are higher year after year, we know the unit is not running efficiently. It might be in ideal condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more efficient model, then you would be losing cash by not replacing the older unit.<p>
