Sources of formaldehyde in the house consist of building materials, cigarette smoking, household products, and using unvented, fuel-burning devices, like gas ranges or kerosene space heaters. Formaldehyde, by itself or in mix with other chemicals, serves a variety of purposes in manufactured items. For example, it is used to include permanent-press qualities to clothing and drapes, as an element of glues and adhesives, and as a preservative in some paints and coating products.<p>
<p>Not all sensing units work the very same way; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes.
