<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall. A ductless system has a built-in performance advantage since up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leaks in your ducts. Since they do not need any new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions.

<p>A main factor in the avoidance of health signs is an efficient, appropriately developed and operating ventilation system.
