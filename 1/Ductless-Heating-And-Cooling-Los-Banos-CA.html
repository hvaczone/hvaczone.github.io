<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was really clear and fast about his assessment, ensuring I understood what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
