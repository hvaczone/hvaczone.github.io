<p>Before you head out and buy an air conditioning system, there are a couple of things to choose first. Where are you going to be setting up the air conditioning system? If your house is not equipped with ductwork, do you wish to set up some or go ductless? How large should the ac system be? Too big and you'll encounter issues with short-cycling, which can harm the air conditioning unit and shorten its life. Too small and your a/c won't have the ability to cool the house appropriately. When going shopping for a new AC system, these are just a few of the factors that you need to take into account. Each option can and will significantly impact your system's performance, which is why you can't afford to disregard any of them.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps simply as important when it concerns central air conditioning expenses, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too large will have a simple time keeping the house cool, however will have a more difficult time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too little will not have the ability to effectively cool the house on hot days. Considering larger systems cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air conditioning system needs to hold.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality problems. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating adequate outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air contaminants out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
