<p>I admit I have not done the math recently, but I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine examinations. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their deal with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the unit sits. I seem like they offer me favoritism, and am willing to pay a bit more for that assurance.<p>
