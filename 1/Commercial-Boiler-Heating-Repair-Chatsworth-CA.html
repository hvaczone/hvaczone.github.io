How do I understand. I now work as a consultant to validate the so called solutions and issues. 9 out of 10, I examine are completely wrong.<p>

<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with questions. He devoted to the task based only on e-mails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the few reasonable ones got. Others were almost twice the quantity Protex priced estimate for low end off brand name devices. I got Provider. ProTex properly recommended me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The set up team was considerate of my home and installed the devices in the expected amount of time. post install inspection results look great for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools far better than the 13 years of age 4 ton R22 system it replaced (also Carrier).<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
