<p>You're probably hearing the fan motor attempting to begin without the boost it requires from the capacitor if you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz. You can almost always conclude that the capacitor has actually failed. Often you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pushing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. But the possibilities are excellent that this may work for one cycle, but the capacitor will fail next time the AC goes on. It's best to replace the capacitor.<p>

Disconnected fuel lines can jeopardize the performance of the HVAC system also. Soot can accumulate in burners and broken heat exchanger s can have an impact on the system's performance too. The maintenance. specialists will evaluate all of these aspects of the furnace and thoroughly and eliminate all obstructions and traces of soot.<p>
