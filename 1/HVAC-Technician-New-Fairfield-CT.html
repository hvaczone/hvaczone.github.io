<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>I am really impressed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business many years earlier and know the significance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise pleased that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
