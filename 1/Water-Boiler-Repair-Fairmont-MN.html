<h3>The Smart Homeowner's Checklist for All Things HVAC Repairin Fairmont MN</h3>
<p>MAINTENANCE PREPARES: Your HVAC system is a financial investment that spends for itself for many years, however only if you protect it to the very best of your ability. Luckily, this does not need to be a task! When you register for a Keefe's maintenance plan, we take care of everything. No matter what make or design of cooling or heating system you own, even if it's a zone control system, you'll get semi-annual examinations, discounted diagnostics, priority service, and fantastic offers on repairs and replacements.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
