I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the visit or the brand-new part. I was extremely happy they stood by their work and repaired the problem. Will certainly be using them once again.<p>

Next, turn off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then yank the detach block (Photo 1) and clean the condenser coils (Photo 2).
