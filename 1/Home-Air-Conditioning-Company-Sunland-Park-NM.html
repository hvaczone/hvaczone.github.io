<p>Appropriate ventilation assists enhance indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are frequently 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and in some cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the same contaminants. In other words, often the air inside can be more damaging than the air outside.<p>
