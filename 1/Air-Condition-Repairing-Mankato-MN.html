<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
