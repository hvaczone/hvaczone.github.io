<p>Air conditioning and refrigeration are offered through the removal of heat.

<p>As you generally need to apply a self-leveling compound on top of the electric underfloor heating system, you must consider the time it takes for this to completely dry before the flooring covering can be put in location - this is usually a day or more. The water-based underfloor heating takes longer to put in place, although this doesn't typically matter too much as it tends to be installed as part of a bigger building or renovation job and installation is finished within a week typically.<p>
<p>Air conditioners can create a great deal of water since they get rid of wetness from the air. To get rid of this, they have a generally plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. With time, algae can block this pipeline and, when it does, the AC won't work. In reality, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can likewise puddle around the system or flood the location. To handle condensate issues, please see Air Conditioner Leaks Water, listed below.<p>
