<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, know that there are maintenance items that just a trained HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can lead to expensive compressor failure, however a house owner doesn't have the tools or skills necessary to examine refrigerant levels.
