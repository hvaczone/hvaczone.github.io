<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary path of direct exposure is through the development of an aerosol impact, many typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from improperly put or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which often release water in an aerosol which might enter neighboring ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical centers and retirement home, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outside water fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial structure water products is extremely under-reported, as healthy people need heavy exposure to get infection.<p>
