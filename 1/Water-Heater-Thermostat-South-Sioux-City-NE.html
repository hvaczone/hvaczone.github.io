<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outdoors - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. These convection heating systems are still commonly utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas. Radon gas enters homes through dirt floorings, cracks in concrete walls and floors, floor drains pipes, and sumps. Exposure to radon becomes an issue when radon ends up being caught in buildings and concentrations construct up inside.<p>

<p>As with the majority of house improvement jobs, the cost of a complete central heater can vary extensively based upon the size of the home.

Heat output is determined in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace must be matched to the size of the house. A little house, for example, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the home too rapidly and shut down for too long, resulting in irregular temperature levels.<p>
