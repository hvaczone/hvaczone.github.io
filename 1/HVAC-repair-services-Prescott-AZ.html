Some sources, such as building materials, home furnishings and products like air fresheners, can launch toxins more or less continuously. Other sources, associated to activities like cigarette smoking, cleaning, redecorating or doing hobblies launch contaminants periodically. Unvented or malfunctioning devices or incorrectly used items can launch higher and often dangerous levels of contaminants inside.<p>
<p>The results of lead exposure on fetuses and children can be extreme. They include delays in mental and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Children, infants, and fetuses are more vulnerable to lead direct exposure than grownups considering that lead is more quickly absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more conscious the damaging results of lead. Children may have higher direct exposures because they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>

<p>New air conditioning unit generally vary from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A higher SEER score indicates higher energy performance and possibly lower energy costs.
