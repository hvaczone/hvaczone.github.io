<h3>The Smart Homeowner's Checklist for All Things HVAC Repairin Kingwood TX</h3>
<p>Among the primary reasons a furnace will run continuously is because something is filthy or clogged up Prior to trying to fix any problem, take time to make certain that the thermostat settings are not at constant fan". Inspect the furnace blower for clogging and clean it if the air filter is good to go. If this does not work, have a look at the furnace blower motor and oil it. Get in touch with a knowledgeable technician if you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running.<p>
<p>Inspect these 3 things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the signs up in the house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the decreased airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or till there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the issue.<p>
