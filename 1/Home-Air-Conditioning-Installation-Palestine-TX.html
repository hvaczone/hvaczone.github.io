<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating sufficient outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
