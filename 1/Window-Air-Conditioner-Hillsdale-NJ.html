<h3>Factors to Consider When Searching for a Good AC Repair Company in Hillsdale NJ</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, conducted a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by enhancing air flow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance. In some cases, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>AC air handler squealing or grinding noises. Though the majority of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units may be belt-driven. Squealing noises from a belt-drive air handler usually take place when the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips. In many cases, the belt is poorly aligned or used and needs replacement. Follow the directions above under Air conditioning unit Not Blowing Air and describe your owner's manual.<p>

<p>Though it might be difficult to think, the air inside your house can be even worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are notorious for decreasing the air quality in your home, but there are numerous other toxins that can not just filthy up the air, but result in other health problems. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning materials and building products contribute to poor air quality, and can likewise cause cancers. VOCs (unstable organic substances) from paint and even from some sort of carpeting and upholstery products can cause issues. Mold and cigarette smoke can be perpetrators, too.<p>
<p>Allergens are materials that trigger an immune-type reaction in people who are sensitized to these products. Allergens found in indoor air are primarily biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these materials are little particles, can become airborne, and hence, are quickly inhaled. Allergens that are breathed in by sensitized individuals with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For example, if you think of a group of individuals with asthma, the existence of cat allergen might induce an asthma attack in people with feline allergic reactions, however not in those people who do not have feline allergies.<p>
<p>The primary health result related to exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may present dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
