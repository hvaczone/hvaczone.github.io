One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then distributed through a piping system under the floor surface. The 2nd is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the floor are forced to resist present, which then creates heat.<p>
<p>Immediate results might appear after a single direct exposure or duplicated exposures. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such instant effects are generally short-term and treatable. Sometimes the treatment is just getting rid of the individual's exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be determined.
