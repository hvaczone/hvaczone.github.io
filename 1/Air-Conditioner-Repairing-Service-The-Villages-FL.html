<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>A geothermal desuperheater is very efficient and beneficial, particularly during the Summer season while the system acts to cool one's house. This is because the excess heat absorbed from within your home is performed into the hot water tank rather than being transferred back into the earth.

Additionally, during winter, the heat from underground can be soaked up to heat domestic water alongside its primary function of supplying space heating. This suggests that cost savings are still realized during the colder duration. In reality, a desuperheater lowers winter season water heating expenses by approximately 50 percent.<p>
