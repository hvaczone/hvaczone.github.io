<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you should watch out for. First, you must examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if totally iced over.<p>
