<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should briefly switch back into the regular cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
