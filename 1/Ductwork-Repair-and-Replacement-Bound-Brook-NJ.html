<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might need a reference later on). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually switched all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>

<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Most furnaces have multiple control panel. The largest, or just one in some furnaces, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards coordinate the operation and manage of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the new control panel must be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t appropriately diagnosed, changing a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable once installed. Itâ $ s a good idea to leave this repair to a professional to identify.<p>
