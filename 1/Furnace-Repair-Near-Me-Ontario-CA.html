<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either since of noticeable growth or a musty odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't eliminate the mold.

New unit cools better than the 13 year old 4 load R22 unit it replaced (also Provider).<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He knew simply what the issue was and repaired it really quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
