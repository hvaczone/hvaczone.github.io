<p>Award Winning Plumbing and HVAC Services. Many common building materials utilized before 1975 contain asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating unit, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials. Generally, significant releases of asbestos fiber do not occur unless the building materials are disrupted, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building renovation. Removal of asbestos-containing products is not constantly optimal since the fibers can be spread into the air throughout the elimination process. A management program for intact asbestos-containing materials is often recommended instead.<p>

<p>If no contaminant sources are found, it is still possible that an indoor air contamination problem exists. Extreme re-circulation of air leads to "stagnant air" conditions. Stagnant air has greater levels of co2 and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air. When ventilation is not sufficient to account for an increase in the number of workers in the location, stale air might also be a problem.<p>
<p>We're investing a lot more time inside, these days. While many people presume contamination is simply an outdoor issue, your home (and workplace) can likewise be polluted. As a society, we ensure that our homes are well-sealed and well-insulated, however we don't think adequate about exposure to all the important things we position in our houses," says Susan Olesik, PhD, Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around structures and structures has a big effect on your health, and while you can feel the signs-- shortness of breath, dizziness, queasiness-- right now, they can begin years after exposure, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Here's how to breathe easier.<p>

<h3>Signs It's Time to Replace Your Boiler in West Hills CA</h3>
<p>Co2 (CO2) is a fairly easy to measure surrogate for indoor contaminants released by people, and associates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are abnormally high inside your home might cause residents to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are normally 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level thought about appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 People are the main indoor source of co2 in many structures. Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
