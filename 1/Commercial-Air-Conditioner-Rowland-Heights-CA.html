Even if you make sure" the condenser coils are clean, tidy them once again. Turn off the power.

<p>I am replacing our High Velocity System because of a serious refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted equipment, a Carrier, Convenience Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also setting up an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding 3 (3) high speed supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will also recycle the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will also install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have a choice for an extra $2,818.00 to install a Carrier Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>Volatile natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals discharged as gases from items or processes; for the a lot of part, you can smell their existence. Typical sources of VOCs indoors consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently innocuous as a new carpet is likely to be emitting formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside might consist of volatile chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water usage.<p>
<p>The majority of companies utilize third party guarantee companies - not YORK. YORK products are backed by a few of the best minimal service warranties in business, consisting of YORK's factory-backed warranty. Since these service warranties lead the HVAC industry in covering parts and crucial mechanical components, you can rest assured knowing you have actually picked the very best furnace and a/c unit for your house or service.<p>
