<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thereby decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
