<p>Find Out About PSR Mechanical. The effectiveness of an air cleaner depends on how well it gathers contaminants from indoor air (revealed as a percentage performance rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering component (expressed in cubic feet per minute).

Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step.
