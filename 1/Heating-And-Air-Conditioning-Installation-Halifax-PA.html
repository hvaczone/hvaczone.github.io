<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, class or lab environments, rather than commercial or outdoor settings. In tasks where union subscription is not a problem, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC system, and installing the ductwork in the structure.

As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, typically mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
