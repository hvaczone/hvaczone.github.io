<p>There are some varieties of mold that contain toxic substances (mycotoxins).

More serious than many allergenic homes is the capability of mold to activate episodes in persons that currently have asthma, a serious respiratory illness.<p>
<p>Some health results may show up quickly after a single exposure or repeated exposures to a toxin. These include inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue.

<p>Sean was very useful. He is an extremely pleasant individual to deal with. No pressure applied to purchase extra stuff. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no issues aside from the blower motor. The only factor he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding sounds. Though many air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units might be belt-driven. Screeching sounds from a belt-drive air handler normally happen when the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips. In most cases, the belt is poorly lined up or used and needs replacement. Follow the directions above under Air conditioning system Not Blowing Air and describe your owner's manual.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
