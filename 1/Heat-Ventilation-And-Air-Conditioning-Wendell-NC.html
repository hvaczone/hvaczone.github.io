<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
