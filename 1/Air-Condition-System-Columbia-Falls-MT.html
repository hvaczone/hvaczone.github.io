<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outdoors - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heaters are still extensively utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."
