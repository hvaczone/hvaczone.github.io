<p>Toxins such as cooking odors, family pet dander, mold, cigarette smoke, and chemical doors may affect indoor air quality and harmful health effects might be created that can threaten homeowners. If members of your household are experiencing particular symptoms such as regular allergic reactions, cold or other breathing issues at home, then it's time for these to be addressed and for your home's indoor air quality to be improved.<p>
<p>In a location where temperature levels reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make great primary heating systems. You'll wish to have a backup system set up, such as a gas furnace, which can take over when temperature levels reach freezing. Your heating technician can install controls which immediately closed down the heat pump if temperatures reach and drop listed below freezing. The controls will call for the furnace to come on, effectively heating the home in these conditions.<p>
