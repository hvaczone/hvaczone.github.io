<p>As a number of you discussed, preventative maintenance is required by all significant devices manufacturer's to guarantee your factory guarantees remain in location. Additionally, the tangible outcomes of a PM is often difficult to measure, as one action specified the cost savings in effectiveness or repairs that were avoided. A lot of pieces of a furnace or air conditioning unit do not simply break at the breeze of a finger, however rather is the result of recurring use of a part that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger may fail too soon due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and triggering early wear and tear, resulting in fractures and holes. If that customer had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and protects the component.  an extremely useful result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a customer thousands.<p>
