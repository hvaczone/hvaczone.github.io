Load calculating is referred to as the Handbook J calculation and should be performed by the HVAC contractor before giving an installation or system cost for a/c. Move to another contractor if your contractor states they know the size of air conditioning system you need based on experience or on square footage alone. Similar to measuring the size of an unit required based on BTUs, figuring out the right size of system for your home also depends on the system load-- how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>

<p>A specific air conditioning system that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard a/c in that both the evaporator and the condenser are positioned in the very same air path. Due to the fact that its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room.

Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the room is actually warmed, just as by an electric heating unit that draws the exact same amount of power.<p>
