<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pressing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them until they have actually been properly dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up. If products with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent check outs, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
