<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Nick B. supplied exceptional, individualized, mindful, and quality service. His communication design is friendly, engaging and reliable. He plainly and thoroughly discussed all problems and repairs in a way that made me confident in his capability to solve my repair problems. He followed through and went above and beyond to personally pick up a needed part that was not in stock, ensuring repairs were made so that my other half and I would not need to withstand another night without heat, during among the coldest winters in recent memory. He also reacted to my call immediately the next morning, and coached me through a short-lived repair to a problem that couldn't be fixed on the very first check out due to unavailable parts. I rely on Nick's skills, experience and capability to deliver consistent, quality service.<p>
