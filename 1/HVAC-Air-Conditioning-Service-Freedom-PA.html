What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my options. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss options. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>

He followed through and went above and beyond to personally get a required part that was not in stock, guaranteeing repairs were made so that my partner and I would not need to withstand another night without heat, throughout one of the coldest winters in recent memory. He also responded to my call immediately the next early morning, and coached me through a temporary repair to a problem that couldn't be fixed on the first go to due to unavailable parts. I rely on Nick's abilities, experience and capability to deliver consistent, quality service.<p>
<p>This review is for changing a 17 year old AC with a new AC, humidifier, air purification system and thermostat. The technician who explained our options did an outstanding job in ensuring we understood the benefits and drawbacks of each option. The professionals who installed the brand-new system were professional and quick, while taking time to ensure we understood how the new system worked. Overall a first rate experience.<p>
