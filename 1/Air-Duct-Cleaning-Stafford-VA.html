<h3>Preventive HVAC Maintenance in Stafford VA</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>The condensate drain in your ac system and heatpump must be devoid of all obstructions and debris. Clogs can obstruct the circulation of condensed water and trigger wetness accumulation within the system. Excess wetness can trigger issues like mold, water damage, high levels of humidity in the home, unequal temperature level regulation, germs, and jeopardized air quality. A professional maintenance technician will clean up the condensate and flush drain to make sure all excess wetness streams away from the system.<p>
