<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summer season. These convection heating units are still extensively used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>

<p>Immediate results may show up after a single direct exposure or duplicated exposures. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and tiredness. Such instant impacts are generally short-term and treatable. In some cases the treatment is just removing the person's direct exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be identified. Signs of some diseases, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might also appear right after exposure to some indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>A third way to choose whether your house might have poor indoor air quality is to look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air contamination. Finally, search for indications of problems with the ventilation in your house. Signs that can suggest your house might not have enough ventilation consist of moisture condensation on walls or windows, stuffy or stinky air, filthy central heating and air cooling equipment, and locations where books, shoes, or other products become moldy. To discover odors in your house, action outside for a couple of minutes, and then upon reentering your house, note whether smells are noticeable.<p>
<p>The predominant health result related to direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your danger of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
