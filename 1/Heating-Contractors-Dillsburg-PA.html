<p>Unstable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals given off as gases from products or procedures; for the many part, you can smell their existence. Common sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently innocuous as a brand-new carpet is most likely to be emitting formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could consist of unpredictable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside during water use.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of contaminant sources is typically essential to figuring out the cause( s) of employee health signs. Such information can often be obtained by asking for copies of air tracking information from the employer.

Review of this data might identify possibly dangerous sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. However, when contaminant concentrations are really low, keeping track of data may not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
