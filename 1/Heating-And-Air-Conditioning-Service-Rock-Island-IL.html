<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC fridges illegal. 30 DuPont and other companies obstructed the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the technique as "that German innovation". 29 31 Nonetheless, in 2004, Greenpeace worked with international corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later on Pepsico and others, to create a business union called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, 4 years later, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric began to take steps to support production and usage in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA decided in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-410a, r-134a and r-404a are, as of 2020, being replaced with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and cooling, R-1234yf in automobiles, R-32 in residential cooling and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration.

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
