<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness. The objective is to provide enough changes to make sure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to achieve this. A typical element required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
