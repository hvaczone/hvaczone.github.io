<p>Current Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

<h3>Ventilation Systems in Drexel Hill PA 19026</h3>
<p>Poor indoor air quality is typically triggered by the lack of appropriate ventilation, which leads to an accumulation of contaminants from sources in the home. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health recognized insufficient ventilation as the primary issue in over half the office indoor air examinations it has performed. Examinations carried out in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have actually found the same to be true. These investigations revealed that correct ventilation is very important in keeping great indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Fantastic service within 24 hr and a fair rate. The technician (Camryn) was really comprehensive and on-time in discussing what services would be performed. Likewise Camryn supplied terrific customer care at the end of the consultation by explaining exactly what he had actually done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a couple of suggestions of some maintenance tasks we might wish to have actually done in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale strategies used by some in the industry.<p>
<p>My oldest boy always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I recognized that it actually didnâ $ t disperse air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually consider anything else other than replacing it. The one I got deserves every cent. The sound level is itâ and low $ s great on energy conserving too.<p>
<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination. For example, people breathe out co2, which in little quantities is not poisonous, but might become dangerous if high concentrations are enabled to collect. Micro-organisms or bacteria may also be present within the ventilation system. If micro-organisms do establish, they may spread throughout the whole work environment or building by methods of the ventilation system.<p>
