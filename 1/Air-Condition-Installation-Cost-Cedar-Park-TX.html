<h3>Geothermal Heat Pump in Cedar Park Texas</h3>
<p>As one of the most crucial investments and pieces of equipment in your home, it pays to keep track of just how effectively and efficiently your warm air oil or gas furnace is running. You need to understand when to change it before it costs you more in repairs than a new purchase or if it becomes risky. A comfortable and healthy  home environment needs an energy-efficient and safe heating unit. One that heats up the house without using big quantities of energy and that does not endanger the indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Great Item! Shipment was kind of odd being that package was opened and items could have fell out. However after review of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The product was very lite weight and takes some time to apply. Keep in mind: purchase suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to view the video first prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After contacting support, we dealt with concerns. I would recommend this item to anybody who's renovating or installing their restroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
