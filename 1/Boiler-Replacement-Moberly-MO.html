<p>The directions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the same. When the electrical wiring is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television warms. Don't put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to properly solidify and cure-- usually 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom floor.<p>
