<h3>HVAC Maintenance Technician in Star City AR 71667</h3>
<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act much like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. If your house or structure has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most inexpensive. Using existing ductwork will eliminate the need to install a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>We take a look at clues before we supply guidance to replace rather than repair a heating unit. One of the ideas we look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to usage, or if energy costs are greater every year, we know the system is not running efficiently. It may be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more effective design, then you would be wasting money by not changing the older system.<p>
<p>Annual furnace maintenance is the very best way to keep your heating unit working safely and effectively. That's why we provide our unique Convenience First Subscription that makes preventive care economical and simple. Ask us about our maintenance program that can conserve you 25 percent on service over the life of your system. Since when you take care of your furnace, it will take care of you with lower energy bills, less repairs, and more years of comfort.<p>
<p>Heavy production markets use a reasonably little percentage of air conditioning service technicians and other HVAC employees, however pay a few of the market's greatest incomes. Electrical power producing companies top the list, with a typical wage of $34.09 per hour or $70,920 per year. Car parts manufacturers, aerospace producers and automobile makers are all within a few cents of each other at approximately $31 per hour, or over $64,000 each year. Railways are another high-wage employer, at approximately $29.33 per hour or $61,000 annually.<p>
