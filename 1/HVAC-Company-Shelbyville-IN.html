<p>Information provided in this safety guide is based on current clinical and technical understanding of the problems presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional borders established by the statutes governing the co-authoring agencies. The standards do not need you to alter your existing central air conditioning units, and replacement parts and services should still be readily available for your house's systems.

When the furnace kicks in and that abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>
