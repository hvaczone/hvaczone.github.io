<p>Another method to reducing the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your home is to increase the quantity of outside air coming inside. The majority of home heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather condition allows, or running a window a/c with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate. Local restroom or cooking area fans that exhaust outdoors eliminate pollutants directly from the room where the fan lies and likewise increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>

<p>You're encouraging the development of mold in wet air if you set it too low. The heat dries the air, preventing mold development and contamination. Of course, too-dry air can also aggravate your lungs and sinuses, while excessive indoor humidity can add to the growth of germs and viruses, according to a 2018 research study in the International Journal of Health and Environmental Health. The perfect humidity in a home is around half, according to the American Lung Association.<p>

<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They provide me priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a brand-new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended guarantees or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never try to sell me something I do not need.<p>
