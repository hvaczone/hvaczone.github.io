<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you ought to examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
