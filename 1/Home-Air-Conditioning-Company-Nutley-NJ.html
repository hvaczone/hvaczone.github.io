They weren't low-cost however a fast internet search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I gladly had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty.
