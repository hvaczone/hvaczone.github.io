<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Current studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do decline them until they have been properly dried. If products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
