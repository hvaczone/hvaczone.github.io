In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
