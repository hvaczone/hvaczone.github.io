<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet.

But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
