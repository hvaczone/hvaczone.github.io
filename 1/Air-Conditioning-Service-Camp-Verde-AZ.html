<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you must examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
