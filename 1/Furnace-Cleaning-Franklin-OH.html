The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the a/c individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor units operate individually from each other.<p>

<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
