<p>All homes require effective ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has been stressed out from usage. Another possible factor could be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adapting to the proper temperature level. Heaters that kick on frequently may be due to a dirty filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal concern. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even an unclean burner.<p>
