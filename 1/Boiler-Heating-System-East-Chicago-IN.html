<p>One of the drawbacks of central heating is that it's potentially expensive to set up, especially in an older house. Depending on the type of system set up, it can be noisy and cause issues if you're extremely allergic to dust. Additionally, specific fuels and equipment may need unique permits, and there is limited versatility in the event of altered heating requirements. Throughout usage, there is a dead time while heat is being carried from the heating system to the home.<p>
<p>We advise using our insulation boards when setting up over concrete slabs. When used in combination with underfloor heating by acting as an extremely efficient thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will save you money. They shows the heat upwards into the flooring tile instead of enabling heat to heat up the concrete slab listed below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after switching on your heating, your floor tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
