<h3>HVAC Company Near Me in Athens TN 37303</h3>
<p>We contacted Elite HEATING AND COOLING on one of the most popular days of summer( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out same day to examine scenario & chose to opt for them for the work. I am happy to say that not just did we get the central air conditioning going however likewise replaced the heating unit which was old. Everybody we spoke to from beginning to end were very professional, considerate and the work was really effectively done. I would highly recommend this company.<p>
<p>Through typical use and the system's presence outside, the coils and fins of the ac system may become extremely unclean. These elements of the devices are crucial for efficient air conditioning. The technician cleans all parts, and checks connections to guarantee they are safe. The system is charged with refrigerant, and all electronic components are examineded for appropriate function and overall condition. This is an excellent opportunity to identify parts that are worn or malfunctioning. Replacing them to fix the cooling might be a lot less expensive when the problem is relatively minor.<p>
<p>If the AC does not turn off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't emit heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can occur in time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must suffice up until you purchase a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>
