<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality at Webster FL</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outside  unit instead of ducting air directly from the outside system. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He understood simply what the problem was and repaired it very rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
