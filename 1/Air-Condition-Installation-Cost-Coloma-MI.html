<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) called us through the CPW program to bid on different home efficiency upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.)

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
