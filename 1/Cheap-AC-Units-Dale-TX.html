<p>The primary problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, workers try to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system produces more difficulties, considering that a few of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the cooling separately for each room. However, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor systems run independently from each other.<p>
