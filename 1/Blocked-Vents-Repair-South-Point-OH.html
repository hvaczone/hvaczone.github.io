<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your house that ideal temperature all year round.

Not just does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it likewise wears down your AC system, which can result in expensive repairs down the road.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is regularly in the variety of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should momentarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
