<p>It is still possible that an indoor air contamination issue exists if no impurity sources are discovered. Excessive re-circulation of air causes "stale air" conditions.

<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to alter your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as important as a regular oil modification in your car. A filthy filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, clean filter better traps contaminants and particles in the air. Energy Star advises changing your filter as soon as every 3 months. Throughout high use months, check the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>

Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
