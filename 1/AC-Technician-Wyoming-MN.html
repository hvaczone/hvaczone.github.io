<p>A hydronic glowing floor heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a maze of pipelines installed under the flooring or right within the flooring surface itself. The heat from the warm water transfers to the flooring mass and then radiates through thermal transfer to other posts with strong mass such as the walls, ceilings, furniture and people. It does not count on heating or moving air to transfer heat.<p>

<p>The majority of well and city water does not usually contain lead. Water typically picks up lead inside the home from home pipes that is made with lead products. If there is lead in drinking water is to have it checked, the only way to understand. Contact the local health department or the water supplier to find out how to get the water checked. Send out for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for additional information about what you can do if you have lead in your drinking water.

<p>Individuals working in buildings with poor IAQ might see unpleasant or moldy smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your physician about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all exposures trigger signs, so there is no substitute for excellent structure management.<p>
