<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the problem.

The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
