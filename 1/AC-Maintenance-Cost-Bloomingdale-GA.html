<p>My oldest son constantly grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a brand-new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I understood that it actually didnâ $ t distribute air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually consider anything else except changing it. The one I got deserves every cent. The sound level is low and itâ $ s great on energy conserving too.<p>
