<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, know that there are maintenance items that just a qualified HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a sluggish refrigerant leak in your AC system can result in pricey compressor failure, but a house owner does not have the skills or tools essential to inspect refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and appropriate airflow are necessary to a well-functioning system, however property owners do not have the necessary equipment for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy house owner, it's still necessary to have an expert technician check the system occasionally.<p>
<p>While toxins typically found in indoor air are responsible for lots of harmful results, there is significant uncertainty about what concentrations or durations of exposure are needed to produce specific health problems. People also react very differently to direct exposure to indoor air pollutants. Additional research is required to better comprehend which health impacts occur after direct exposure to the typical pollutant concentrations discovered in houses and which happen from the greater concentrations that take place for short time periods.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos items consist of vinyl asbestos floor tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement items. These products present a danger only when they are dealt with in a way that produces dust including asbestos fibers which can be inhaled. When asbestos-containing materials are damaged or interrupted by repair, remodeling, or demolition activities, tiny fibers can become airborne if proper controls are not in location. This can lead to the potential for substantial health issue.<p>
