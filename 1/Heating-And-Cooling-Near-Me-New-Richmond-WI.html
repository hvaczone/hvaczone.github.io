<h3>How To Prevent Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in New Richmond WI</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, carried out a research study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by enhancing air flow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no considerable improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy efficiency. In many cases, measured particle levels really increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
