The Guideline prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid).

<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely practical in collecting details on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to temporarily deal with the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and provided clear communication about the issue, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will absolutely use Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and home.<p>

<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have issues, they provide me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I don't need.<p>
