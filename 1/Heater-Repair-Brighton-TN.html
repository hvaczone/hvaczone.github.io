<p>A packaged system, typically installed on the roofing system, is most frequently used on commercial buildings, but it is also an option for homeowners to think about. Many times, these systems consist of not only the air conditioning unit itself however likewise a furnace. A benefit of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged systems are great for those looking to conserve money on the installation of a new cooling and heating system independently, considering that the system is combined. However, one con is that these units are normally just readily available for larger homes due to their high power and capacity. In addition, while they can be a great way to conserve cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more costly than buying just a cooling system.
