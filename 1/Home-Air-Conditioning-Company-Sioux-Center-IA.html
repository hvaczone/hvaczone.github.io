<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Most heating systems have several control boards. The largest, or just one in some furnaces, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards control and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the new control board must be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the concern isnâ $ t properly detected, altering a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable when installed. Itâ $ s smart to leave this repair to a professional to diagnose.<p>
