<p>An indoor air pollutant is a compound in the air that might affect the health of people who reside in the home. Contaminants might originate from outside the home-- such as an idling car engine in a connected garage, yard garbage burning, or radon entering your house from the ground listed below. An air pollutant could also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a defective furnace, volatile natural substances (VOCs) from a newly painted space, secondhand smoke, mold growing on damp or damp carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, household cleaning, or personal care items. Infections and bacteria, pet dander, and bug parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>

<p>The predominant health impact associated with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
