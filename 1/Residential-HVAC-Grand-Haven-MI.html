<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable with time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably the same physical material with time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
