<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts.
