<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outdoor unit as near to your house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.)

<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer season cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>As with the majority of house enhancement jobs, the cost of a full central heating unit can differ extensively based upon the size of the house.
