<p>Right now, countless allergen, dead skin cells, building and construction debris, and mold might be residing in your house's air ducts, impacting the air you breathe along with the efficiency of your heating and cooling system. Indoor air quality isn't on many people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a danger to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a recent survey by the Consumer Reports National Proving Ground.

Eye and breathing system irritation, headaches, lightheadedness, visual disorders, and memory problems are among the instant symptoms that some people have experienced right after direct exposure to some organics. At present, very little is understood about what health effects happen from the levels of organics usually found in homes. Numerous natural compounds are understood to cause cancer in animals; some are presumed of triggering, or are known to trigger, cancer in human beings.<p>

<p>Advanced ventilation systems that make it possible for higher airflow from the outside, air quality tracking platforms and sensing units, and new air filtration innovations are ending up being more typical as readily available options in residential and commercial HVAC product packages.

<p>Individuals working in structures with poor IAQ may discover musty or undesirable smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are becoming worse, talk with your doctor about them. However not all exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no replacement for good building management.<p>
