<p>Recent Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
