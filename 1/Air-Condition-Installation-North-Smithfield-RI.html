<p>A ducted heatpump looks like a big central air conditioning conditioner unit that sits outside your house. Heatpump operate on electrical energy and work like a/c unit in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air.

<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs silently and efficiently, however to have two major parts fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the billing before work started. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, suggesting they use air to exchange heat, in the very same method as a vehicle radiator or common household air conditioner does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It gathers water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which should be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outdoors air.<p>
