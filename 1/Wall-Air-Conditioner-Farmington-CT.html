<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil.

Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
