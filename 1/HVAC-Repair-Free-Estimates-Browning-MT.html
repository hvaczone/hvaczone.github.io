<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Design, Building and Commissioning is designed for designers, design engineers, contractors, commissioning representatives, and all other professionals worried about indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the house include building products, cigarette smoking, household items, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning home appliances, like gas ranges or kerosene space heating systems.
