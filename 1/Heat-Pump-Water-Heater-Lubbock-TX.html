Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no substitute for excellent structure management.<p>
