<p>It might feel cozy being sealed in tight against the cold in your home throughout the chillier months of the year, but for individuals who are sensitive to indoor irritants or have respiratory problems, winter can exacerbate problems. Stale indoor air and heating systems can increase the amount of allergy-inducing allergen, animal dander, and mold spores flowing through your house. In late winter and early spring, it may still be too cold to toss open the windows to pull out the musty air, so while you wait for the warmer weather condition it is necessary to be knowledgeable about a few of the allergic reaction and respiratory triggers that may be lurking in your surroundings.<p>
<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Most furnaces have multiple control boards. The biggest, or only one in some heating systems, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards manage and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the new control board must be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t appropriately identified, altering a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable when installed. Itâ $ s smart to leave this repair to a professional to diagnose.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality problems. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in adequate outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
