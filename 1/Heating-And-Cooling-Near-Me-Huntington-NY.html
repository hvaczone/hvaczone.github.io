<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning On Your Huntington NY Home</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, sending the absorbed heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression procedure. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>

For instance, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air therefore the highest concentrations inside structures are normally near the ceiling. Alternatively, ozone is much heavier than air and stays near the flooring.<p>
