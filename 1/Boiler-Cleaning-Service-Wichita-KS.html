<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heating system, think about prospective results of indoor air contamination. Follow the maker's directions, particularly guidelines on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heater properly changed. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is generally an indication of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While an area heating unit is in usage, open a door from the room where the heating system lies to the remainder of the house and open a window a little.<p>
