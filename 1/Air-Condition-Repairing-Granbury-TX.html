<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The very same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils makes sure dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>

<p>While these steps will assist to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that only a skilled HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause costly compressor failure, but a house owner doesn't have the skills or tools needed to examine refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and correct airflow are vital to a well-functioning system, but homeowners do not have the required devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy homeowner, it's still necessary to have a professional technician check the system periodically.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air issues by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often emit pollutants.) However, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Regardless of the kind of electric radiant flooring heater, all are factory-built to remain in one piece and not cut, broken or altered.
