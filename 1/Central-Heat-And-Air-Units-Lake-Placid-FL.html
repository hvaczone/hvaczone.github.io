<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
