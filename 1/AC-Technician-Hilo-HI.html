Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Additionally, really unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
