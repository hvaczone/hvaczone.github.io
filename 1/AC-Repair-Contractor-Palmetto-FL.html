Protexs offer was one of the couple of sensible ones got. Others were almost twice the amount Protex priced estimate for low end off brand name devices. I got Provider. ProTex effectively recommended me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The install team was respectful of my home and installed the equipment in the expected amount of time. post install inspection results look very good for braising and pipes quality. New system cools far better than the 13 years of age 4 lot R22 system it changed (likewise Provider).<p>
