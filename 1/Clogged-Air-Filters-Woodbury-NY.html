<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. If your air conditioner is short on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks. Simply including refrigerant is not a service if it leakages. An experienced technician should repair any leak, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the appropriate amount of refrigerant. Bear in mind that the efficiency and effectiveness of your air conditioning system is biggest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the maker's requirements, and is neither overcharged nor undercharged. Refrigerant leakages can likewise be hazardous to the environment.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outdoor system as near to your house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>Assessing the Performance of Your HVAC System at Woodbury NY</h3>
<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) called us through the CPW program to bid on numerous home performance upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took sufficient time to assist us dispute which upgrades were cost reliable, which upgrades we could do ourselves and what would yield us the largest savings.

<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may need a reference in the future). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Photo 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
