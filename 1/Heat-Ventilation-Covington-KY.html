<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your house at optimal efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will need a much larger AC system than a smaller home, which will impact installation expenses. Also a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air flow will require far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfy. Other factors that can impact this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the structure, roofing, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>

<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was very valuable in gathering info on the phone and offering clear guidelines about how to briefly cope with the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and provided clear communication about the issue, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will absolutely utilize Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and home.<p>
