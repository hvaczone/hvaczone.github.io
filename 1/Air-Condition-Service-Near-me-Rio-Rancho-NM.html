I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>

I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance.
