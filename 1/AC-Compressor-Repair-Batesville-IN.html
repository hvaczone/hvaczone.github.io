A really efficient collector with a low air-circulation rate will not be effective, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less efficient collector. The long-term performance of any air cleaner depends upon preserving it according to the manufacturer's instructions.<p>

<p>Airflow patterns in building are determined by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural impacts. Atmospheric pressure differences developed by these forces move airborne toxins from locations of greater pressure to locations of lower pressure through any readily available opening in structure walls, ceilings, floorings, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is little, air will move until the within pressure amounts to the outside.<p>
<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered into force in 2000 and banned the use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Guideline prohibited using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that devices that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
