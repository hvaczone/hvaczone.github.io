<p>There is no single test to discover an IAQ issue. Your employer should inspect measurements of humidity, temperature level and air flow. In addition, evaluation and testing of the ventilation, heating and a/c systems (to make certain it is working according to requirements for developing usage and tenancy) should be performed. A structure walk-through to look for odors and try to find water damage, leaks, dirt or bug droppings might be useful. Leaks need to be eliminated. Standing water in humidifiers, cooling units, on roofing systems and in boiler pans can become polluted with fungi or bacteria and need to be removed, also. In some situations, particular testing for radon or for asbestos may be needed as part of building tenancy. For instance, in schools asbestos requires to be inspected every three years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Threat Emergency Response Act-AHERA).<p>

<h3>The Benefits of Routine HVAC Maintenance at Audubon NJ</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The existing pattern in house building and construction is to lower air leakage through cracks and other openings in roofings, walls, and floors. The combination of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has resulted in an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much greater. This fresh makeup air dilutes indoor pollutants and helps tire them from the house.<p>
<p>Since it has to run longer than a properly sized system, an undersize unit won't be able to cool rooms down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate. An oversize compressor likewise costs more to run because it merely takes more electricity to run a bigger system. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has an opportunity to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the essential wetness. The outcome is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level suggests. In fact, the room can feel clammy and moist.<p>
