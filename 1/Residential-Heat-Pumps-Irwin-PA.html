<p>Asthmatic kids are especially at threat. EPA estimates that direct exposure to pre-owned smoke increases the variety of episodes and seriousness of signs in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic kids, and may cause countless nonasth-matic children to establish the disease each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition intensified by exposure to previously owned smoke each year. Exposure to previously owned smoke causes nose, eye, and throat inflammation.

They might spread out throughout the entire work environment or building by methods of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do establish.<p>
