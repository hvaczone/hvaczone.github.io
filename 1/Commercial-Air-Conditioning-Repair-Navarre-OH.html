<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have actually become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
