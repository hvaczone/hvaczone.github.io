<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
