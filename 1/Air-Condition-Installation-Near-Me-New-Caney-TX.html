<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the main problem. While installing a separate split system, employees attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal.

The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the a/c separately for each space. However, now the marketplace has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor systems operate individually from each other.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great.
