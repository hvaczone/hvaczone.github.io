<h3>The Smart Homeowner's Checklist for All Items HVAC Repairin Centreville MD</h3>
<p>I have been utilizing Waychoff for about 10 years. First, they repaired a bad installation from a previous company. Afterwards, they have maintained my system semi-annually. Their techs are expert and really experienced. Expenses are reasonable. Constantly on time, and call when they are on their method. Waychoff installed a brand-new air handler and condenser this week. I did not bother to get rival's quotes because of my trust in Waychoff since the cost was obviously affordable.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical mix used in autos in the U.S. up until 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be purchased and utilized by certified HVAC service technicians. For systems needing just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and performing far much better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "low-cost" by many people.<p>
