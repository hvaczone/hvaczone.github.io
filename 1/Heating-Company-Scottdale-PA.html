<p>Since they eliminate moisture from the air, Air conditioners can create a lot of water. To eliminate this, they have a typically plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Gradually, algae can block this pipe and, when it does, the AC will not work. In fact, some condensate drains have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the area. To handle condensate issues, please see Air Conditioner Leaks Water, below.<p>

<h3>Tips for Quick Furnace Repair at Scottdale PA</h3>
<p>Co2 (CO2) is a reasonably easy to measure surrogate for indoor pollutants produced by human beings, and associates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are uncommonly high inside might cause residents to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are normally 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level thought about acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Human beings are the primary indoor source of co2 in many buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are an indication of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
