<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outside unit as near your house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely experienced of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

We never felt rushed and Taylor's technical knowledge of IES's services and products was impressive. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to an affordable level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while allowing me to carry out the required electrical improvements to minimize cost.<p>

<p>A cars and truck's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and lastly loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant ends up being dirty and old.

A coolant flush is standard maintenance for your automobile's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or check out Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill requirements.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps just as important when it pertains to central air costs, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too large will have an easy time keeping the home cool, however will have a harder time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too small will not have the ability to appropriately cool the home on hot days. Thinking about larger units cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
