If the compressor starts but the fan doesn't, the fan motor is more than likely shot. Shut down the power and get rid of the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and eliminate the fan blade and motor (Image 7). Reinstall the blade and protect the cover. Then repower the system and see if the fan starts. If  it doesn't, you've provided it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
