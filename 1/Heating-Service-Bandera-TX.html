<h3>What You Need to Know About Air Conditioner Repair in Bandera TX</h3>
<p>Aspects that can contribute to the growth of biological pollutants are wet or damp structure materials (carpets, ceilings, walls) and inadequately maintained humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and a/c unit. "Humidifier fever" is a common disease brought on by incorrect maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs. Various fungis and bacteria grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these contaminants can be dispersed into the air and breathed in by the building occupants. Other possible sources of biological impurities are pets and family plants.<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding noises. Though many air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older systems may be belt-driven. Screeching sounds from a belt-drive air handler generally happen when the belt that links the motor to the blower slips. In many cases, the belt is improperly lined up or used and requires replacement. Follow the guidelines above under Air conditioning unit Not Blowing Air and refer to your owner's manual.<p>
