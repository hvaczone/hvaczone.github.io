<p>Lots of people underestimate the degree of the indoor air contamination problem. Air pollution is usually visualized as the black smoke produced from factories. Little thought is offered to tobacco smoke and the spin-offs of aerosol sprays, pesticides, cleaners, and paints utilized in the home. To intensify the issue, it is approximated that the average American spends 70 percent to 90 percent of his/her time inside, and over half that time is invested in the home.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summertime air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
