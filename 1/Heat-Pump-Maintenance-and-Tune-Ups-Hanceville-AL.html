<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in Hanceville AL</h3>

<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a pipe two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "hard part" once a year shut off the electricity open the furnace and extremely thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the elements, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
