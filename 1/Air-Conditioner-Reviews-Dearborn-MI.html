He came in a few hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the circumstance to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He used to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the nicest, most good individuals I have actually satisfied in a long time. We need to support the real people who are there for us if we want to have alternatives to ACME heating.
