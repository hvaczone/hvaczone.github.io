These undetectable electro-magnetic infrared waves radiate out from a warmed thermal mass. In an included system like a home, the warmer objects naturally heat the cooler ones till a balance is achieved.<p>
<p>Both need to be kept tidy because an air conditioner moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outside coil. This means that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise essential to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately lead to damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
