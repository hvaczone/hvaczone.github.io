It might also consist of the installation of signs up where the ductwork links to specific areas.<p>

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, created by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in buildings through natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
