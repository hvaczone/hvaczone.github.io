<p>When they place a 24 hour emergency ac repair demand, a lot of Midtown Houston Tx clients do not know why their HVAC unit is not working. The copper lines at the outside system we'll be frozen too if your evaporator coil is frozen. Depending on how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing unit, then you'll have an excellent concept of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you're in luck, that's probably your problem. The next step is to defrost your air conditioning equipment if you found that your conditioning filter needs changing. The easiest way to defrost your HVAC devices is to leave the system off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you need to check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
