<p>Excellent Item! Shipment was kind of strange being that the box was opened and items might have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we assured it was all undamaged. The product was incredibly lite weight and takes some time to apply. Keep in mind: buy recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make sure to watch the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions precisely. , if you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had issues with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we dealt with concerns.
