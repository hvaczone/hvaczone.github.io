Many companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to correctly service and the system has been operating issue complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
