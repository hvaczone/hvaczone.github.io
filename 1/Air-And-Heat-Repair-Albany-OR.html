<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more difficult to manage than they seem due to aspects such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity needs to be maintained at or listed below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to decrease mold development.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness. The goal is to supply adequate changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this. A common element necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
