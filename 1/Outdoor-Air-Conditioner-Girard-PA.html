Not all heaters are good for all houses, and there are a number of elements that definitely need to be thought about prior to picking one. Initially, you'll need one that is appropriately sized for your house. A furnace that is too big will put out too much heat for your system to handle, and will cause problems like short-cycling that can shorten its life. A furnace that is too small, on the other hand, will not have the ability to supply enough heat to keep your home comfy.<p>
