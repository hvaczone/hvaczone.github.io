<p>Lots of Canadian jurisdictions do not have particular legislation that handles indoor air quality issues. In the lack of such legislation, the "basic task stipulation" applies. This clause, common to all Canadian occupational health and safety legislation, specifies that a company should provide a healthy and safe workplace. Therefore, making sure the air is of excellent quality is the company's task.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things first. Make sure all the signs up in your house are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the reduced airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's great airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
