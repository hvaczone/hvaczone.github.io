<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs silently and effectively, but to have 2 major parts stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the billing before work started. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

These initiatives changed the market where an increasing variety of low-emitting products has become available during the last decades.<p>
