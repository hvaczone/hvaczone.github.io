<p>Indoor air contamination is brought on by burning solid fuel sources - such as fire wood, crop waste, and dung - for cooking and heating. The job of an HVAC technician is relatively complex and can vary considerably from one office or home to the next. Every maintenance job and repair is different from the last.

The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).
