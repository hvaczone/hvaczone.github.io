<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outside - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summertime. These convection heating units are still extensively used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>

The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning separately for each room.
