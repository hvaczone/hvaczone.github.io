<h3>Turning to the Right Company for the Right Furnace Repair in Putnam CT</h3>
<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the job based only on emails, showed up and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the few reasonable ones received. Others were almost two times the quantity Protex priced quote for low end off brand name equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex appropriately advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The install group was respectful of my house and installed the equipment in the expected quantity of time. post install evaluation results look excellent for braising and pipes quality. New system cools much better than the 13 years of age 4 load R22 system it replaced (likewise Carrier).<p>
