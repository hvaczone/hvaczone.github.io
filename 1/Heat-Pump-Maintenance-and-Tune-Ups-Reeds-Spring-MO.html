<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pushing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them till they have actually been properly dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up. Try a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
