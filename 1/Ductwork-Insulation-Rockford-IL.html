<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He understood simply what the issue was and repaired it really quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
