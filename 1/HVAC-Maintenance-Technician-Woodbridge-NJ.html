<p>Truth: Geothermal systems actually take in no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that exact same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceptionally unusual now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually remove countless gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
<p>A geothermal heating unit does not produce its power by burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, or gas. Instead, it takes in heat from within the earth.

This makes a geothermal heater an attractive solution to cut your carbon footprint, offering a favorable effect on the environment.<p>
