<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the rate great but Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my home to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I believe any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me relating to an uncommonly high expense that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he understood that I had actually called the service manager and left a message of concern.

He resolved the concern in one day, had adjusted the costs to what I thought about reasonable before he recalled, understood what might have triggered the problem and had a plan to insure that it would not take place again. I have thought about All Points a company with stability for the nine years we have used them. This experience validates that.<p>
