Without it, you have no cooling. Depending upon its placement on your residential or commercial property and its maintenance, it may sustain some damage throughout the winter season. Most of the time, this just includes some accumulation of dirt and debris, which is pretty easy to remove. Your Sacramento HVAC technician will wipe the outside of the unit and ensure that there is no rust, damage from accumulated moisture, or extreme wear to the outside. They might advise that you trim back thick trees or bushes to make sure appropriate airflow around the system.<p>
