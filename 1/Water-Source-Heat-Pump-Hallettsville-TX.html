<p>Old lead-based paint is the most substantial source of lead exposure in the U.S. today. Hazardous exposures to lead can be produced when lead-based paint is incorrectly removed from surface areas by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of air-borne lead particles in houses can also arise from lead dust from outdoor sources, including polluted soil tracked inside, and use of lead in certain indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Lowering pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outdoor) air to water down polluted (indoor) air. Local building regulations most likely define the quantity (and in some cases quality) of outside air that must be constantly supplied in your structures, as do voluntary standards set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Temporarily increasing ventilation paired with proper use of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for example, can be useful in watering down the concentration of poisonous fumes in the air.<p>

<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, managing the power to the heating wires and also controling the temperature level of the floor. All electrical wiring for your radiant heat system either runs to it or from it. The majority of people will install their thermostat near the entryway of the space they are heating, near the light switches. Nevertheless, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the location is dry and unobstructed.<p>

The EPA advises humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to lower mold growth.<p>
