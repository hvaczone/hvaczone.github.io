<p>Today's house radiant heat systems maximize infrared radiation. By far, the most common source of a radiator in a house is the flooring mass. Radiators can be locally located in one area like a restroom flooring or be set up across the entire sub-surface of the home's floors. Other radiators are still utilized, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heating units-- although ceiling radiators are almost always utilized in commercial applications like warehouses.<p>
<p>HVAC is a fundamental part of residential structures such as single household homes, apartment, hotels and senior living centers, medium to big industrial and office complex such as health centers and high-rise buildings, vehicles such as cars and trucks, trains, ships, submarines and planes, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy building conditions are controlled with regard to temperature level and humidity, utilizing fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>Generally the most efficient method to improve indoor air quality is to get rid of private sources of pollution or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be adapted to reduce the quantity of emissions. Oftentimes, source control is also a more affordable technique to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Specific sources of indoor air pollution in your home are noted later on in this section.<p>
