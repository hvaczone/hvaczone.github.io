<h3>Hints to Help You Repair Your Furnace in Wyncote PA</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The existing pattern in home construction is to decrease air leakage through fractures and other openings in floors, walls, and roofing systems.

The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much higher. This fresh cosmetics air dilutes indoor impurities and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>

To avoid straining an air conditioner's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You must hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, try to find an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
