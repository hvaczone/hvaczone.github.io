<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a musty odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and inspect. Leaky return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Once again, if you suspect a mold problem, think about having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
