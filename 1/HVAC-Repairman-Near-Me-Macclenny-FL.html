<p>Packaged terminal a/c unit (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have two separate systems (terminal bundles), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening going through the wall and linking them. This reduces the interior system footprint and enables each room to be adjusted separately. PTAC systems might be adapted to provide heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, converting the air conditioner into a heatpump While space cooling supplies maximum flexibility, when utilized to cool lots of spaces at a time it is generally more costly than central air.<p>
