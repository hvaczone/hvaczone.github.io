<p>Air conditioning can also be provided by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator.

At the same time, heat is absorbed from inside your home and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>

If a source of water or condensation can be discovered, chances exist will be mold growing close by. Repair the moisture issue, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly tidy the area utilizing established health department recommendations.<p>
