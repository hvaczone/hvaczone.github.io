<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise because 1978. If your air conditioning unit is low on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks. If it leakages, merely including refrigerant is not a service. A skilled technician must fix any leakage, test the repair, and then charge the system with the right amount of refrigerant. Keep in mind that the efficiency and performance of your ac system is greatest when the refrigerant charge precisely matches the maker's requirements, and is neither overcharged nor undercharged. Refrigerant leaks can also be hazardous to the environment.<p>

CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system parts, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
