<h3>Furnace Repair Near Me in Bridgewater Massachusetts</h3>

Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and check. Dripping return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Once again, if you believe a mold problem, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
