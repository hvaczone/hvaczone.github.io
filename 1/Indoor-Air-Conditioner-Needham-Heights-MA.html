<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in structures via mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Co2 (CO2) might not be the most pernicious element impacting indoor air quality, but it is often used as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more occupants there remain in a space or structure, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from increasing too high-- which can have an unfavorable impact on residents-- outside air should be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
