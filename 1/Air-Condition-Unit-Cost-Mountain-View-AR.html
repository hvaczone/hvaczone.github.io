The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
