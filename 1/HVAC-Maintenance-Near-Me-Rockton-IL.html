<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment usually lasts years, because it is secured indoors. When it does require to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most pricey to install. New technical standards remove the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely.

<p>The main reason house owners do not purchase an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 per year, depending upon the amount of services provided.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold.

To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to temporarily change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
