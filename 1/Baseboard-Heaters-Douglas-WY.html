<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summer. These convection heating systems are still extensively used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>

<h3>Water Source Heat Pump in Douglas WY 82633</h3>
<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act similar to standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most budget-friendly. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the need to set up a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
