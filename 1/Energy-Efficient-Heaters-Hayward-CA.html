<p>Recent Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my choices. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over options. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family pal and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>
