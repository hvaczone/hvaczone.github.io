<p>If the AC does not turn off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't produce heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can occur gradually due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts.
