<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet.

But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
