<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your home. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils makes sure dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
