<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was extremely useful in collecting information on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to momentarily cope with the problem and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and provided clear interaction about the issue, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will certainly use Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and house.<p>
<p>The split system is the most common. Most people are used to seeing this key in the backyards of houses. With split system units, most of the parts are housed in a metal box beyond the house. However, there are some internal components also. Split systems are perfect for cooling several rooms at once, but are not really energy efficient. For that reason, one pro is not having loud devices in the house. At the exact same time, the con would be that those who use this may invest more money on cooling costs in the long run because of the lower energy effectiveness.<p>
<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have concerns, they provide me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I don't need.<p>
