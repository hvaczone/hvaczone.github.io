<p>An undersize unit will not be able to cool spaces down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate since it needs to run longer than a properly sized system. An oversize compressor likewise costs more to run because it merely takes more electricity to run a bigger system. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity efficiently. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has an opportunity to distribute the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the needed moisture. The result is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature indicates. In fact, the room can feel damp and clammy.<p>
