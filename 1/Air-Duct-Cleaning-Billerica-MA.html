<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the ac system works but the house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>
