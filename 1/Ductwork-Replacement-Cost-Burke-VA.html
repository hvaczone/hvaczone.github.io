<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical material gradually. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
