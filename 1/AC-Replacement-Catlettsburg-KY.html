<h3>Boiler Repair and Water Boiler Problems in Catlettsburg KY</h3>
<p>Sean was very helpful. He is a very enjoyable person to deal with. No pressure applied to purchase extra stuff. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no problems besides the blower motor. The only factor he might not install the brand-new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
