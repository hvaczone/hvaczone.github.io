<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. When I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the rate excellent however Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
