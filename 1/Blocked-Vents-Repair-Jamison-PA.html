The system runs silently and effectively, however to have 2 major parts stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the billing prior to work started. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you wouldn't offer them.  Secondly like prolonged auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required abilities to do the task and also the morals to treat clients fairly.

Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to properly service and the system has been operating issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>Oil heaters are normally not very efficient. They use less fuel than other furnace types, but many do not attain a performance higher than 90%. A few high-end brands have an effectiveness of 95% by using a condenser. These are more pricey, having beginning costs for the furnace itself at around $5,000. You pay more for the installation also since a drain needs to be set up.<p>
<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Many heaters have multiple control boards. The biggest, or just one in some heating systems, is sometimes called the Motherboard. The circuit boards collaborate the operation and control of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, however the new control board should be set up exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the concern isnâ $ t properly identified, changing a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable as soon as installed. Itâ $ s a good idea to leave this repair to a pro to diagnose.<p>
