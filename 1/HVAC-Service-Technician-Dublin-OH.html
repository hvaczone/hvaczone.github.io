<p>There is no easy response, but many use the guideline that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is most likely a better solution. If the existing system has not sustained other significant repairs, remains in otherwise outstanding condition, and concerns that led to the breakdown can be identified and remedied, repairing the unit can make a lot of sense also.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioning conditioner, you may select to change the outside compressor with a contemporary, high-efficiency system. Speak with a local heating and cooling contractor to assure that the new compressor is effectively matched to the indoor unit if you do so.
