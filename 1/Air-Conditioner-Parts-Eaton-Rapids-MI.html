<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outside system as near to the house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
