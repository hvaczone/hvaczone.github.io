<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly receives ask for assessment and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies.

However, many of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Prior to choosing whether to repair or change your condenser and blower units, your technician needs to run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and measuring how much air gets away the system.<p>
