<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity specialist at a big retailer who asked not to be called because he did not have permission to speak on the record, it is common for big retail operations to have a team that consistently keeps track of energy consumption and temperatures in shops to save on expenses (especially in the evening) and to alert store supervisors if temperatures in the stores change beyond an acceptable range that might avoid consumers from shopping at the store.<p>
