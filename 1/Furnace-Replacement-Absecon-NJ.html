<p>How climate change impacts air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a basic mode of operation for modern a/c) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c boost. This increase has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system should increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
