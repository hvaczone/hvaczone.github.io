<h3>Home Furnace in Dunbar WV 25064</h3>

<p>Before you go out and purchase an air conditioner, there are a couple of things to choose initially. Where are you going to be setting up the air conditioning unit? If your house is not outfitted with ductwork, do you want to set up some or go ductless? How big should the a/c unit be?

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being ineffective in more severe cold.

To compensate for this, the heat pump system should temporarily change back into the regular cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
