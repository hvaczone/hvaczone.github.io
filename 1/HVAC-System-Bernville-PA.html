To ensure the system you pick is the ideal size for your house, the Sears HVAC specialist does an electronic load estimation quote to determine the specific type of heat and cooling system that's perfect for your home-we do not just change it with the exact same size unit you presently have. These estimations think about things such as the size of your house, its exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This step is necessary so the unit isn't too little or too large-both waste energy.<p>
<p>The life-span of a central air unit is considered to be 15-20 years, and today's ac system are more energy efficient than models made 5 years ago, so it makes financial sense to replace or upgrade your unit if it's 5 years of ages or older. The very best central air conditioner you can purchase today will use 30-50% less energy than one purchased in 1975 while delivering the exact same amount of cooling.<p>
