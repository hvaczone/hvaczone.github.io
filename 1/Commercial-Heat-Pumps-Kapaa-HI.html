<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile tube) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>

If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do decline them until they have been properly dried. If items with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent check outs, try a various dry cleaner.<p>
