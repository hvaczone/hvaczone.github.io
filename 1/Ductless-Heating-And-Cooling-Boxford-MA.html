<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Principles in Boxford MA</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went terrific. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to get rid of the old hot water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heater. We selected getting something more costly than a traditional water heater as gas is among our biggest energy expenditures. We feel that this brand-new system will last a very long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
