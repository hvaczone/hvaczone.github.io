It takes extremely little time to warm up or cool down your house which is one of the important things we didnâ $ t obtain from the one we had in the past. The unit hasnâ $ t needed any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
