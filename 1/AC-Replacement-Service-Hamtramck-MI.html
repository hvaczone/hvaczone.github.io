<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>Through normal usage and the unit's presence outside, the coils and fins of the a/c may become very dirty. These aspects of the equipment are crucial for effective air conditioning.

This is an outstanding chance to recognize parts that are used or malfunctioning. When the problem is relatively minor, changing them to repair the air conditioning may be a lot less expensive.<p>
<p>Generally the most effective way to enhance indoor air quality is to remove private sources of contamination or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be adjusted to reduce the amount of emissions.

<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working throughout times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for house residents.
