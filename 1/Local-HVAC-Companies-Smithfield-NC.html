<h3>Indoor Air Conditioner in Smithfield NC 27577</h3>
<p>I normally don't leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate needing to change your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my options. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family pal and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>

<p>If the AC doesn't switch off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not give off heat effectively and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can occur with time due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts.
