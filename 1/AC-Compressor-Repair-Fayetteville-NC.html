<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in Fayetteville NC</h3>
<p>All contemporary a/c systems, even small window package units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like product, and must be changed or cleaned as conditions necessitate. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters altered more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy expenses; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. In addition, very filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
