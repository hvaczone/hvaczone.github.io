<p>The heat pump acquired appeal in the 1950s in Japan and the United States. 12 Heat pumps can draw out heat from different sources, such as ecological air, exhaust air from a building, or from the ground. Heat pumps move heat from outside the structure into the air inside. Initially, heat pump HVAC systems were only used in moderate environments, but with enhancements in low temperature level operation and reduced loads due to more efficient houses, they are increasing in appeal in cooler environments.<p>

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
