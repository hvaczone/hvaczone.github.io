<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>The most common type of house heating system in the U.S. burns gas or lp to produce heat. With an average cost that ranges from $2,500 to $14,000 to set up, they are not the least expensive choice, but more recent systems can be extremely energy efficient. According to the Department of Energy, older natural gas systems usually attain a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while newer, extremely efficient natural gas furnaces can attain AFUE rankings as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
<p>This evaluation is for replacing a 17 year old AC with a brand-new AC, humidifier, air purification system and thermostat. The technician who discussed our choices did an outstanding job in making sure we understood the benefits and drawbacks of each choice. The professionals who set up the new system were fast and expert, while taking time to make sure we understood how the brand-new system worked. Overall a very first rate experience.<p>
