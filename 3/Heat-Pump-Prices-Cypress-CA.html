<p>As a lot of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant equipment manufacturer's to guarantee your factory service warranties remain in location.

For example, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon because the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and causing early degeneration, resulting in fractures and holes. If that customer had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and protects the component.  a very advantageous result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a client thousands.<p>
