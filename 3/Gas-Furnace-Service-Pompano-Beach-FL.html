<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace specialists often find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Look for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of typical cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years or two. Loosen the old AC contactor before removing the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new unit (Picture 6).<p>
