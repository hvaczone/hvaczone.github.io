<h3>AC Duct Replacement in New Holland PA 17557</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
