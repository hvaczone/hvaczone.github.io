<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more difficult to manage than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity must be preserved at or listed below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to lower mold development.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) might not be the most pernicious element impacting indoor air quality, however it is frequently utilized as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more residents there remain in a room or building, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from rising expensive-- which can have a negative impact on residents-- outside air needs to be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
