<p>Packaged terminal a/c unit (PTAC) systems are also called wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have two different units (terminal plans), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and enables each space to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in winter, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioner into a heatpump While room a/c supplies maximum versatility, when used to cool lots of rooms at a time it is usually more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>

<h3>Different types of HVAC Repairs in Little Rock AR</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was really clear and fast about his inspection, ensuring I understood what was watched out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>

<p>Since my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose spent time fixing the issue, all the while discussing everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working properly. He had to go get the correct replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
