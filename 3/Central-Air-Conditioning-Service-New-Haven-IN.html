<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act much like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. If your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most cost effective. Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the requirement to set up a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

Having faulty ductwork makes your system work harder with even worse results. Your home will not be properly cooled, and your energy bills will increase.
