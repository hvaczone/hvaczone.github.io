<p>While pollutant levels from individual sources may not posture a significant health risk by themselves, many houses have more than one source that adds to indoor air contamination. There can be a serious risk from the cumulative effects of these sources. Fortunately, there are steps that the majority of people can take both to minimize the danger from existing sources and to avoid brand-new problems from happening. This security guide was prepared by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Customer Item Safety Commission (CPSC) to help you decide whether to do something about it that can lower the level of indoor air pollution in your own house.<p>
<p>The possibility of immediate reactions to indoor air toxins depends on a number of elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two crucial influences. In other cases, whether an individual reacts to a pollutant depends upon individual level of sensitivity, which differs greatly from individual to individual. Some individuals can become sensitized to biological pollutants after duplicated direct exposures, and it appears that some people can end up being sensitized to chemical pollutants too.<p>
