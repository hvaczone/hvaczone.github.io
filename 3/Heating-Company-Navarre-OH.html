<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c works but your home does not cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
