We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are typically 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and in many cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the very same contaminants. To put it simply, in some cases the air inside can be more hazardous than the air exterior.<p>
<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are described hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often referred to as merely radiant systems.

When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout your home. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the flooring, and into the space. This is why the technique is described as radiant heating.<p>
