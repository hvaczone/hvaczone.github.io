<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered force in 2000 and banned using ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems.

<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
