<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace professionals typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Look for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>There are a great deal of advantages to using a radiant heat system over a traditional forced air heater.
