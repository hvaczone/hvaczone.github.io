<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might need a referral in the future). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Remove the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've swapped all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
