<p>The very first ac system and refrigerators utilized combustible or toxic gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that could lead to fatal mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion home and structure convenience cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
<h3>Air Condition Company in Elmer New Jersey</h3>
<p>If you think a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a musty smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and inspect. Leaky return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you believe a mold problem, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>We're spending a lot more time inside your home, these days. While lots of people presume pollution is simply an outdoor problem, your home (and office) can also be contaminated.

The air quality within and around buildings and structures has a big result on your health, and while you can feel the symptoms-- shortness of breath, lightheadedness, queasiness-- right away, they can come on years after exposure, according to the federal Epa (EPA). Here's how to breathe easier.<p>
