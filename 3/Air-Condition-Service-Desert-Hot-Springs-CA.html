<p>Dometic's commercial grade roof air conditioning unit are performance-tested to get rid of unusual or harsh roadway and weather conditions. Many basic systems break down after just 4 hours of severe vibration screening, while the Vigorous II is still going strong at 30 hours and more! The galvanized steel leading plate offers enduring strength while long copper lines minimize vibration and, for that reason, sound too. While being one of the most difficult air conditioners around, its 410A refrigerant is kinder to the environment. Robust, light-weight and capable of carrying out in any environment!

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended duration of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 need to be calibrated regularly, and outside measurements used for computations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors may also be required.<p>
<p>Current Review: They were terrific! So many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to supply you with the service initially asked for. They met my needs totally by supplying a professional quote with options, without pressing extra products. The team appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also without delay followed up with the needed assessments from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely recommend this company.<p>
