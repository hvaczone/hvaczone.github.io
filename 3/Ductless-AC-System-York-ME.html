<p>I typically do not leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my choices. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over choices. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household pal and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
