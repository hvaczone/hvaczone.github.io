<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace at Livonia MI?</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went excellent. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the whole day as they required to get rid of the old water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heating unit. We picked getting something more pricey than a traditional water heater as gas is among our greatest energy expenditures.
