<h3>The Way to Maintain Healthy Ductwork To Get A Healthy Home in Sweetwater TX</h3>
<p>In-floor heater can come with specific health benefits. The hotter the air, the drier it becomes. On those days when you just can't seem to heat up and discover you need to show up your thermostat, your furnace can draw all the humidity out of your home and leave your sinuses throbbing. In-floor heating systems are not vulnerable to this concern due to the fact that they heat surface areas and not the air itself. Furthermore, because they do not rely upon fans, ducts, signs up and returns to disperse hot air, in-floor heating systems can minimize the amount of dust and seasonal allergens in your home.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is generally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
