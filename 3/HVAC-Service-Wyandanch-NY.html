<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heat pump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also changes functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on. With time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll discover the motor running hotter. Prior to that takes place, you want to get those capacitors altered to prevent further damage to your system.<p>
