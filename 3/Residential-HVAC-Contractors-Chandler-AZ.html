<p>MacDonald-Miller's focus is on preventative maintenance by utilizing clever innovation. Martin stated the company can establish a dashboard within the structure's controls that will provide data on its systems to permit real time visibility, supplying the ability to be preventative rather than reactionary.

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't use them.  Secondly like extended auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the necessary skills to do the task and likewise the morals to treat clients relatively. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be entirely benefited from. Most companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to properly service and the unit has been running issue free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
