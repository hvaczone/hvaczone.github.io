<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
