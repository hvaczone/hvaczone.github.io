<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heat pump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
