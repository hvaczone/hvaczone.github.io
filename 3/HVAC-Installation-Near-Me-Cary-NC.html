<p>How climate modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants.

This boost has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit should increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning system's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
