<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outside unit as near your house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise changes functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
