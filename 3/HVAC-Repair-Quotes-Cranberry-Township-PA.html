<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
