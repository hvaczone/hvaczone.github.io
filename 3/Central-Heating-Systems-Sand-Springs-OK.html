<h3>Gas Central Heating Systems in Sand Springs OK - The Benefits</h3>
<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wood floor joist system, underneath the wooded subsurface and final flooring finish. This is normally used in a third-floor or second location and benefits from the flooring joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and extra thickness of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber radiant floor heat hydronic system effective, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are set up under the pipelines to direct heat up.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
