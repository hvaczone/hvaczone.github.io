<p>The exhaust outlets allow all dangerous gases to leave your property so there's no dangerous accumulation of carbon monoxide and other such gases. If the exhaust outlets are obstructed, they can lead to a hazardous accumulation and compromise your safety. The technician will examine all of these aspects of your system and check the chimney flue and vent stack as well. They will try to find indications of corrosion, leaks, and back draft and repair the problem during their maintenance runs.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, know that there are maintenance items that just a trained HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can lead to costly compressor failure, however a house owner doesn't have the abilities or tools essential to examine refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and appropriate airflow are necessary to a well-functioning system, however homeowners do not have the essential devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart homeowner, it's still necessary to have an expert technician examine the system periodically.<p>
<p>Remember, too, that you might wish to speak to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heat pump systems can have various heating and cooling capacities.
