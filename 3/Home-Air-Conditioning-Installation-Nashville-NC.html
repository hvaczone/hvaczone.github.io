And if the storeroom has a concrete floor, place two 2x4s beneath the box to raise it up and safeguard it from moisture.<p>

<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, be aware that there are maintenance items that only a qualified HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a sluggish refrigerant leak in your AC system can cause pricey compressor failure, but a house owner does not have the tools or skills essential to inspect refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and correct air flow are important to a well-functioning system, but homeowners lack the required devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy property owner, it's still essential to have a specialist technician examine the system periodically.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: They were terrific! So many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to offer you with the service originally asked for.

And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly recommend this company.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an essential function in indoor air quality.

Those processes include generating outdoors air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, distributing that air throughout the building, and moving some part of indoor air exterior. The quality of indoor air will be affected if one or more of these processes are underperforming.<p>
