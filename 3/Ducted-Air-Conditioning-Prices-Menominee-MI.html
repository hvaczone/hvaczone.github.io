Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The reduced air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous registers were closed or the filter was clogged. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's excellent airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it.
