<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the primary issue. While installing a separate split system, employees attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system produces more difficulties, since a few of indoor units can be located far from the exterior. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the cooling separately for each space. However, now the marketplace has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor systems operate individually from each other.<p>

To make up for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
