Heat pumps run on electrical energy and work like a/c in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air.

They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
<h3>Ductwork Repair and Replacement in Mansfield Louisiana</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & knowledgeable throughout the go to. They suggested replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive however a fast internet search verified WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning.

<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach beside the compressor and the main panel.

You should hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, try to find an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
