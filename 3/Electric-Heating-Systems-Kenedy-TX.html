<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either because of visible growth or a musty odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and examine. Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Again, if you believe a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
