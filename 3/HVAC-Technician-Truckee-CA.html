Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Additionally, really filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
