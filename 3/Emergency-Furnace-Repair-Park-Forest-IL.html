<p>It prevails to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical material over time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
