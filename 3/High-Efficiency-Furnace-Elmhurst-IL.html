<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to provide your home that ideal temperature level throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining some of those typical air contaminants. Ultimately, their air filters fill and stop doing their task. Not only does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can cause costly repairs down the road. So, make certain to alter your AC filters routinely, or get a cooling service plan which usually includes a filter modification - specifically if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, prior to the air is flowed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
