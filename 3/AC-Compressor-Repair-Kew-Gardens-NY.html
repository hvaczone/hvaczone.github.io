When I called and he recommended me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working once again, he helped me problem shoot the concern. He is honest, reputable, and reasonable on price. It's tough to find a sincere AC man and I'm pleased I found Luis. Extremely advise Luis and his company.<p>
