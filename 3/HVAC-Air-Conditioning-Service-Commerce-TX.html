<p>Recent Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
