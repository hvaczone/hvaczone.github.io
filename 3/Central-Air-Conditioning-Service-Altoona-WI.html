<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for a/c repair, which you must keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
