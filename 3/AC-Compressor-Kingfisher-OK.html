<p>I'll begin with a gas furnace due to the fact that it's the most typical heating unit in Seattle houses. Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your home through ducts, and cool air is gathered through cold air return vents. Gas heaters are rated for performance.

If your house already has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a relatively uncomplicated process. If you are including on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting, setting up a new gas furnace system can be quite costly.<p>
