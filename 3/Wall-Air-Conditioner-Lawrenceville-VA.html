<p>The icing issue ends up being a lot more extreme with lower outside temperature levels, so heat pumps are commonly set up in tandem with a more standard type of heating, such as an electrical heater, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized rather of the heat pump during harsher winter season temperatures.
