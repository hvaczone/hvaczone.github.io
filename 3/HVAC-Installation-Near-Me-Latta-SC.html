<p>Make sure there are no carpets, furniture, or anything else limiting the circulation of air.

Closing off vents and registers in unused spaces is NOT a great concept. You will not save any extra money and will wind up causing more problems for your heater.<p>
<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
