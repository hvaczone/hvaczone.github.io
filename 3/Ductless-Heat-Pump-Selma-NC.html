<p>It is common to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady gradually. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as fairly unchanged physical material gradually. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
