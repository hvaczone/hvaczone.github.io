<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the rate fantastic however Mark headed out of his method to tailor a few things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
