<h3>Heater Repair in East Rockaway New York</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the property.<p>

<p>Reinstall the access panel and detach block. Turn on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and await the AC to begin (see Be Patient at Start-up," below). The compressor must run and the condenser fan should spin. The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor begins but the fan does not. Shut off the power and eliminate the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and remove the fan blade and motor (Photo 7). Re-install the blade and protect the cover. Then see and repower the unit if the fan starts. , if it doesn't, you have actually offered it your finest shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
