<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine components. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator requires dealt with by professionals, see Acme Auto Electric & Repair today.<p>
