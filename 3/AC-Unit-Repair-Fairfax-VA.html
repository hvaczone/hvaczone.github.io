<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more challenging to control than they seem due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity ought to be maintained at or listed below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to reduce mold growth.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is usually routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
