<p>The probability of immediate reactions to indoor air pollutants depends on numerous factors. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two essential influences. In other cases, whether an individual responds to a toxin depends on individual level of sensitivity, which varies tremendously from person to person. Some people can become sensitized to biological pollutants after repeated exposures, and it appears that some people can end up being sensitized to chemical pollutants too.<p>
<p>Indoor environments are highly complicated and structure residents might be exposed to a range of impurities (in the kind of particles and gases) from office machines, cleaning items, building home furnishings, activities and carpets, perfumes, cigarette smoke, water-damaged building materials, microbial development (fungal, mold, and bacterial), pests, and outdoor toxins. Other elements such as indoor temperature levels, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also impact how people respond to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not bringing in sufficient outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air contaminants out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
