<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must momentarily change back into the routine a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost.
