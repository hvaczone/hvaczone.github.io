<p>Truth: Geothermal systems in fact consume no water. All the water is returned to that same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceedingly rare now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact remove millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
<p>When the temperatures keep climbing, geothermal air conditioning is a cost-effective and smart way to cool down your house or location of service. However when your AC system quits working effectively or begins to breakdown, you need a knowledgeable contractor to come in and get it fixed as rapidly as possible. Which's where we can help.
