<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for ac system repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you need to inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
