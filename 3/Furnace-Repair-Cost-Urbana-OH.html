<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wood flooring joist system, below the wooded subsurface and last flooring surface. This is generally utilized in a third-floor or second location and benefits from the flooring joist cavities while preventing the cost, weight and extra thickness of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber glowing floor heat hydronic system efficient, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are set up under the pipelines to direct heat up.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is usually a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
