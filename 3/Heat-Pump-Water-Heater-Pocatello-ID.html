<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you should look out for. First, you need to inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
