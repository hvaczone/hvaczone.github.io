<h3>Different types of HVAC Repairs in Boaz AL</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, transferring the soaked up heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas.
