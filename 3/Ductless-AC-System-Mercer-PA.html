<p>I have utilized all the time for 5 plus years now. I have signed an annual maintenance contract which covers two services every year. Ilan has actually been wonderful through all these years. Always keeps my system serviced and tuned. Haven't had any problems. Whenever he sees any concerns, he notifies me about it and proactively repairs the parts. Really pleased with their service.

<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in Mercer PA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was quick and very clear about his assessment, guaranteeing I understood what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He knew just what the issue was and fixed it extremely quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
