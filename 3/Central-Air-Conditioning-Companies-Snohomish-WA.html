<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
