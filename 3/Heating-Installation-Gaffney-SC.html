<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Start by calling RJ Heating if your furnace stops working. We frequently find that a simple repair or modification is all that's needed to help it run correctly once again.
