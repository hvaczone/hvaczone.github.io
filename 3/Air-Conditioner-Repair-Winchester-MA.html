<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the same. As soon as the electrical wiring is total, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Do not put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to correctly treat and solidify-- typically 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
<p>Since my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung around repairing the problem, all the while discussing everything to me.
