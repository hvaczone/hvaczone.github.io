<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He devoted to the task based only on e-mails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the couple of sensible ones got. Others were nearly twice the amount Protex estimated for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex effectively advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The install group was respectful of my house and set up the devices in the anticipated amount of time. post set up examination outcomes look great for braising and pipes quality.

<p>Indoor impurities.
