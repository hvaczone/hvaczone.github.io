<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often gets requests for consultation and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation procedure. However, much of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Due to the fact that they get rid of moisture from the air, Air conditioners can produce a lot of water. To eliminate this, they have a generally plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. Over time, algae can obstruct this pipeline and, when it does, the AC won't work. In fact, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the area.
