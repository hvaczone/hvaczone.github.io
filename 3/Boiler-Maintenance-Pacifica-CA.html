<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Information For Pacifica CA Home Owners</h3>
<p>After residing in our home for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to replace the cooling. I went ahead and bought this Provider and I must say it gets the job done quite well. It takes really little time to heat up or cool off your home which is one of the important things we didnâ $ t get from the one we had in the past. The unit hasnâ $ t required any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix used in autos in the U.S. up until 1994, when most styles altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be purchased and used by qualified HVAC service technicians. For systems needing just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and carrying out far much better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "inexpensive" by lots of people.<p>
