Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was definitely happy to have a heated house once again. What's most remarkable was that this all occurred throughout Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find somebody to help us right before a holiday, however Environment Pro came through for us. I will gladly suggest this company to my friends.<p>
