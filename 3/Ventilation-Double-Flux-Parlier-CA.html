<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his staff members, devices expenses, marketing, energies, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay.

Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is really heated up, just as by an electric heating system that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>
