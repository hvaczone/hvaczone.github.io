During high usage months, examine the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>

<p>Measurement treatments are being established and shown to examine building ventilation and indoor toxin concentrations. These procedures vary from sophisticated tracer gas techniques used predominantly in developing research efforts to less involved treatments that can be used by developing operators. NIST researchers are continually developing new test treatments, and then demonstrating them in the field to assess their feasibility and dependability. The efforts in which these procedures are demonstrated in the field has led to the advancement of an essential database of building ventilation and indoor air quality performance.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is likewise evidence from animal research studies that repeated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. People at specific danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and individuals with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
<p>Individuals working in structures with bad IAQ might see unpleasant or musty odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are becoming worse, speak with your medical professional about them. But not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no replacement for excellent structure management.<p>
