<h3>Vertical Air Conditioner in San Mateo California</h3>
<p>It is still possible that an indoor air pollution problem exists if no pollutant sources are found. Extreme re-circulation of air leads to "stagnant air" conditions. Stagnant air has higher levels of co2 and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air. When ventilation is not sufficient to account for an increase in the number of workers in the area, stagnant air might likewise be an issue.<p>
<p>Similar to homes, the most crucial element affecting indoor air quality is the existence of toxin sources. Commonly discovered office toxins and their sources. consist of environmental tobacco smoke; asbestos from insulating and fire-retardant building products; formaldehyde from pressed wood items; other organics from building products, carpet, and other workplace home furnishings, cleaning materials and activities, bathroom air fresheners, paints, adhesives, copying machines, and photography and print shops; biological contaminants from filthy ventilation systems or water-damaged walls, ceilings, and carpets; and pesticides from pest management practices.<p>
