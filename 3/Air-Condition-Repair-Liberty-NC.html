<p>To say there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's a little-known truth that the quality and cleanliness of your air ductwork is just as crucial as your HVAC system. Dust and grime will often build up in ductwork, limiting airflow. Since ductwork is so complex, duct cleaning and duct maintenance can seem very complicated at first, requiring specialized tools, equipment, and know-how. When you go with Service HQ's duct cleaning services, you won't have to stress over a thing.<p>
<p>The life-span of a central air unit is considered to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioning unit are more energy efficient than models made 5 years back, so it makes financial sense to replace or update your system if it's 5 years old or older. The best central air conditioning conditioner you can buy today will utilize 30-50% less energy than one bought in 1975 while providing the exact same quantity of cooling.<p>

<p>Many people undervalue the level of the indoor air pollution issue. Air contamination is typically envisioned as the black smoke released from factories. Little idea is provided to tobacco smoke and the by-products of aerosol sprays, paints, cleaners, and pesticides used in the home. To intensify the issue, it is approximated that the average American spends 70 percent to 90 percent of his/her time inside, and over half that time is invested in the home.<p>
<p>We're investing a lot more time inside your home, nowadays. While many people assume pollution is simply an outside problem, your house (and office) can also be contaminated. As a society, we ensure that our homes are well-insulated and well-sealed, but we do not think enough about exposure to all the important things we position in our houses," states Susan Olesik, PhD, Teacher of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around structures and buildings has a huge result on your health, and while you can feel the symptoms-- shortness of breath, dizziness, queasiness-- right away, they can come on years after exposure, according to the federal Epa (EPA). Here's how to breathe much easier.<p>
<p>Most HVAC systems now have programmable thermostats that permit property owners to control the temperature level and set it on a schedule. For instance, you can set the thermostat to lower the heat when you're not in home to conserve cash on the energy expenses and make sure the system isn't overloaded. A professional technician will examine the thermostat throughout the annual maintenance to ensure the real temperature and the temperature level on the thermostat matches. The technician requires to inspect the thermostat's efficiency or assess the entire HVAC system if there's a difference in the temperature.<p>
