<p>As much of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment maker's to ensure your factory service warranties stay in place. Additionally, the tangible results of a PM is typically tough to measure, as one action stated the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were avoided. The majority of pieces of a furnace or air conditioning system do not just break at the snap of a finger, however rather is the result of repetitive use of a part that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger might stop working prematurely because the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature deterioration, resulting in holes and cracks. If that client had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the element.  an extremely useful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>
