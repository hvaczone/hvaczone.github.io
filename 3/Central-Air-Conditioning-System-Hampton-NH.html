There have actually been awkward sounds. I got it repaired and examined. I am hoping that is the end of the issue. Overall, it has actually been a great experience. Dependable on the whole. Neat operation and excellent cooling system. Yes, I was not pleased with its looks in the start. But then realized Air conditionings are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
