<p>Forced air systems are the most common heating system types on the market, however they're not constantly the very best option for each house. If you're looking for a new heater for your house, you should take a look at a few of the other alternatives available prior to deciding on a system that may not fit your needs best.

<p>If your single stage air conditioning unit isn't old enough to validate replacement, think about an entire home dehumidifier.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture. The goal is to provide enough modifications to make sure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to achieve this. A common component required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
