<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- because they can be inhaled.

Break outs in medical facilities and assisted living home, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually included outdoor fountains in public tourist attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water materials is highly under-reported, as healthy people require heavy exposure to acquire infection.<p>
