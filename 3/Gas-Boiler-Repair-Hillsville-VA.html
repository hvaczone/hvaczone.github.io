<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness, Air cleaning occurs. The objective is to offer sufficient modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to achieve this. A typical component needed in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
