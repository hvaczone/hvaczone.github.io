<p>Before you go out and buy an air conditioner, there are a couple of things to decide first. Where are you going to be setting up the ac system? If your house is not equipped with ductwork, do you want to install some or go ductless? How large should the air conditioning unit be? Too big and you'll encounter issues with short-cycling, which can damage the air conditioning system and reduce its life. Too little and your a/c will not have the ability to cool your house appropriately. These are simply a few of the elements that you need to consider when buying a new AC system. Each option can and will significantly impact your system's efficiency, which is why you can't manage to disregard any of them.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps simply as essential when it comes to central air costs, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too large will have an easy time keeping the house cool, but will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not be able to correctly cool the house on hot days. Considering larger units cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air conditioning system needs to hold.<p>
