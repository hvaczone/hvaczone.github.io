<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical material over time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
