<p>After living in our home for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to change the a/c. I proceeded and purchased this Carrier and I need to say it gets the job done rather well. It takes really little time to warm up or cool down your home which is one of the important things we didnâ $ t receive from the one we had in the past. The unit hasnâ $ t required any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the room temperature level, and after that switch it ON. To prevent straining an a/c's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
