<p>Ask about training and certifications. An excellent place to start is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) certification. It's type of a minimum requirement for selecting an HVAC company, however a lot of contractors out there haven't bothered with it!

Supervisors with BPI certification understand that the home is a system and see HVAC equipment as simply one aspect (out of many) of a comfortable environment.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by including brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes give off contaminants.) However, measures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas area heating system, consider potential effects of indoor air contamination. Follow the producer's directions, especially directions on the proper fuel and keeping the heating system effectively changed. A relentless yellow-tipped flame is typically an indication of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While a space heating system remains in use, open a door from the space where the heating system lies to the remainder of the home and open a window somewhat.<p>
