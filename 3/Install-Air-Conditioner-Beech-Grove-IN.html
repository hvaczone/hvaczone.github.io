<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the consistent heat distribution over the whole surface of a floor heats up the lower half of the space, enveloping occupants in heat at a lower overall temperature level-- in many cases approximately 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a traditional heater." In other words, in-floor heating systems supply a different mode and level of convenience. And, as various public awareness campaigns have long reminded us, the more comfortable we feel, the more likely we may be to nudge down our thermostat, in turn decreasing our energy expenditures.<p>
