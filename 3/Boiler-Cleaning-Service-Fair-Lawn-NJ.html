<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pushing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them up until they have actually been effectively dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up. Attempt a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
<p>Heating is also one of the most significant energy consumers in your house, so property owners who might be buying a brand-new furnace should thinking about replacing it with a newer, more energy-efficient model to save cash and assist the environment. The average furnace lasts between 15 and twenty years, so you're making a significant financial investment in your house. Spend sensibly by learning as much as you can about offered options.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating sufficient outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
