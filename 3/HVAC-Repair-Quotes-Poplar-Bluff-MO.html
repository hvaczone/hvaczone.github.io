<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as a Necessary Business in Los Angeles.

<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of typical cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every 5 years or so.
