<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
