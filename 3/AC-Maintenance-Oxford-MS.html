<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical product gradually. In reality, the real nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
