<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summer.

<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan.

Unscrew the old AC contactor before removing the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new system (Image 6).<p>
