<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your house at maximum effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will require a much larger AC unit than a smaller sized house, which will impact installation costs. Likewise a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air flow will need far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfy. Other factors that can affect this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>The capability of natural chemicals to trigger health effects varies significantly, from those that are highly poisonous, to those without any recognized health impact.
