<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the same. Once the electrical wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Don't put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to correctly solidify and cure-- normally two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
