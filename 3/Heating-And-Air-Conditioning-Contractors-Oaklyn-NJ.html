<p>AC units and thermostats have built-in hold-up functions when they're shut down and then repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've registered for an energy-saving device from your local power energy, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you have actually installed the parts revealed and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature level below the indoor temperature, and the unit doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based.

Portable instruments utilized to determine co2 must be calibrated frequently, and outside measurements used for computations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors may likewise be required.<p>
