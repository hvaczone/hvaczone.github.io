In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather.

The temperature level of the incoming air is decreased, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the getting in air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite significant if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
