<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.<p>
