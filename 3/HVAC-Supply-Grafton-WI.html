<p>Called WSE for a regular assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & educated throughout the see. They recommended changing a few parts that were going out. They weren't cheap but a fast web search verified WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I gladly had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was defective. No charge for the see or the brand-new part. I was really pleased they stood by their work and repaired the issue. Will certainly be using them again.<p>

Setting up a new geothermal heatpump to deal with an existing ground loop is far more affordable.<p>
