<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sanitizing services are classified as an Essential Company in Los Angeles. Today's furnaces are rated 90% efficiency or much better; it is not unusual for a modern-day furnace to be rated 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older models, which may be rated as low as 80% performance, this can indicate substantial savings in yearly heating expenses. Modern 2- and three-stage heating systems increase effectiveness even further by running at lower or greater capacity depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>When trying to figure out how often I ought to change my air conditioning filters, there are many things to take into factor to consider. Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 home has a distinct DNA on how it collects dust and dirt. It takes about 6 months of close observation to see how often your a/c filter gathers dirt and dust. After that, you can make a better ideal decision on how typically your HVAC filters need replacing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 homes have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 home, the less often you'll have to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 houses with only one a/c filter require changing regularly.<p>
