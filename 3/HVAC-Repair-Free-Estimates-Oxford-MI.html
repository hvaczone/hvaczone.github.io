<p>Individuals working in buildings with poor IAQ might discover musty or unpleasant odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out.

Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues.
