<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>

A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine parts. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs handled by experts, check out Acme Car Electric & Repair today.<p>
