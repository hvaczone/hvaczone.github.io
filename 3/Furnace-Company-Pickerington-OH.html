<h3>Install New Air Conditioner in Pickerington OH 43147</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also changes functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
