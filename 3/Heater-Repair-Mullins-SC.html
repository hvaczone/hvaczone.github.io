<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives requests for assessment and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. The probability of instant responses to indoor air toxins depends upon several aspects including age and preexisting medical conditions. Sometimes, whether an individual reacts to a contaminant depends upon specific sensitivity, which varies tremendously from individual to individual. Some individuals can end up being sensitized to biological or chemical pollutants after duplicated or high level direct exposures.<p>

That's approaching 30 to 40 percent of the whole real estate market.<p>
