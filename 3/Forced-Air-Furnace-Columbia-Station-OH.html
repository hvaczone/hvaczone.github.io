<p>Truth: Geothermal systems in fact take in no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that very same aquifer.

<p>A packaged system, generally installed on the roofing, is most frequently used on commercial buildings, but it is also an alternative for property owners to consider. Oftentimes, these systems include not just the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are terrific for those wanting to conserve cash on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system separately, because the unit is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are normally only available for larger houses due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be a good way to save money on a total HVAC system, they're still considerably more expensive than purchasing just a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the very best option for homeowners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
