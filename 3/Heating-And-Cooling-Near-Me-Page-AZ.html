Heaters that kick on often may be because of an unclean filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air correctly.

Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible tube) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
