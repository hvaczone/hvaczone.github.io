<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most typical cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too quickly, and your house will not warm up. Change the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A filthy filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<h3>Preventive HVAC Maintenance in Piqua OH</h3>
<p>I admit I have not done the mathematics lately, but I've had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular inspections. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their deal with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the system sits. I seem like they give me favoritism, and want to pay a bit more for that peace of mind.<p>

However, the molecular weight of some compounds makes them gravitate toward the floor or ceiling; depending upon what toxin you're attempting to track you'll need to position the sensor accordingly. For instance, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air and so the highest concentrations inside buildings are normally near the ceiling. Alternatively, ozone is heavier than air and remains near the floor.<p>
