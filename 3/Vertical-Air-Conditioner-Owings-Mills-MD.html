I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with various prices and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who described to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another occasion. He helped me difficulty shoot the issue when I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working again. He is sincere, trustworthy, and reasonable on cost. It's difficult to find a truthful AC guy and I'm thankful I found Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
