<p>Geothermal heating is one of the most efficient heating sources in terms of environmental costs.

<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They give me priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Purchased a brand-new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy extended warranties or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not need.<p>
