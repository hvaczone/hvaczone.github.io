<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise because 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one constraint: their total power needs to not exceed the capacity of the outside unit. In practice, however, it is really common to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor systems higher than the outside capability by at least 20%. However, it is incorrect to anticipate much better efficiency when all indoor units are switched on at the same time, because the overall capacity of the entire system is limited by the capability of the outside unit.

The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor units run independently from each other.<p>
