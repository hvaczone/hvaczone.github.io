The primary route of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol impact, most typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from badly put or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which might enter neighboring ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical facilities and assisted living home, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually involved outside fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial structure water products is highly under-reported, as healthy people need heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
