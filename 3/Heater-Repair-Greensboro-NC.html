<p>I am an investor, I need to replace 2 heating systems in a 8000square foot house.

Radiant heat systems tend to be far more energy effective than other heaters, for something. Forced air heater tend to experience things like duct leakages, which rob them of up to 30% of their output.

<p>An undersize system will not have the ability to cool spaces down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate since it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit. Due to the fact that it merely takes more electricity to run a bigger system, a large-scale compressor also costs more to run. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has an opportunity to flow the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the essential wetness. The result is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature indicates. In truth, the room can feel clammy and damp.<p>
