<h3>The Benefits of Buying A New Furnace in Marion IL</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping between a outdoor and indoor system rather of ducting air directly from the outside unit. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct handle air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is generally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
