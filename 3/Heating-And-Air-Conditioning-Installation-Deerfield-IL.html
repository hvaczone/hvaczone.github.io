The average daytime temperature highs range from the low to upper-70s during June, July, and August, and when heat waves go through the community, temperatures will increase to the mid-80s. Central air conditioning units keep homeowners of Redmond comfortable and cool indoors when correctly set up and well kept.<p>
<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system.
