<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to briefly switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
