My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>

<p>I generally do not leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You do not expect needing to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my choices. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about options. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>We have actually been using Keefe's for years and have always been very pleased. They offer excellent repair install and the customer care is terrific. We recently had a concern with an older unit and contacted us to establish a day and time to have it checked. They sent out James Bell and he was great. He made the effort to discuss our alternatives cost differences and was really well-informed professional and practical. Delighted consumers. " Mathew Licausi.<p>
