Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile hose) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
