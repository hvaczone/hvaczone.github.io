<p>All houses need efficient ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others.

When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also switches functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
