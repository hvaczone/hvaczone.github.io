<h3>Immediate Purchase HVAC Equipment at Xenia OH</h3>
<p>Another method to decreasing the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your house is to increase the amount of outside air coming indoors. Many house heating and cooling systems, including required air heating unit, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening windows and doors, operating window or attic fans, when the weather allows, or running a window air conditioner with the vent control open increases the outside ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen fans that tire outdoors eliminate impurities directly from the room where the fan lies and likewise increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>

<h3>AC Unit Repair in Xenia OH 45385</h3>

<p>EER represents Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people don't use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more challenging to control than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity should be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to decrease mold development.<p>
