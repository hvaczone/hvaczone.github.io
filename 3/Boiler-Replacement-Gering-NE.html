<p>At present, EPA does not advise utilizing air cleaners to lower levels of radon and its decay products.

EPA's brochure, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, offers further information on air-cleaning devices to lower indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 ought to be calibrated often, and outdoor measurements used for estimations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors might likewise be required.<p>
