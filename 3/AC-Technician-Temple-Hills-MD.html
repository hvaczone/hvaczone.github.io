<p>House owners may likewise assume that due to the fact that a glowing floor heating system can be viewed (and funded) as a home improvement, its installation will instantly raise their house's worth. No proof exists suggesting that in-floor heating either favorably or negatively affects property values. In-floor heating is not even tracked in the yearly Cost vs. Value Report issued by Hanley Wood Media, publishers of Improvement Publication. Possibly Realtors must consider too many variables to definitively mention what a radiant heating system may add to, or deduct from, any given asking price. That said, property buyers aiming to go green," who focus on energy savings, or who definitely desire an in-floor heater will want to pay a premium for a house that features one.<p>
