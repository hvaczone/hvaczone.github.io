<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his workers, equipment costs, marketing, energies, and other expenses prior to paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, particularly if the goal of owning an organisation was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it took to construct the business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% typically isn't completion goal. HVAC entrepreneur should pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their earnings while keeping expenses the same in all other locations.<p>
