<p>Space air conditioning unit include a thermostat sensing unit, located behind the control panel, which measures the temperature level of air entering into the evaporative coil. If the sensing unit is knocked out of position, the ac system could cycle constantly or behave erratically. The sensor ought to be near the coil but not touching it; change its position by thoroughly flexing the wire that holds it in location.<p>
