Setups can likewise vary significantly, depending on the age of the structure and how well the existing system was installed. In many cases, entirely new ductwork might require to be set up in a structure that had none before.<p>
<p>In a split-system central air conditioning conditioner, an outside metal cabinet contains the condenser and compressor, and an indoor cabinet includes the evaporator.

The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future.

<p>Space air conditioning unit include a thermostat sensing unit, located behind the control panel, which measures the temperature level of air entering into the evaporative coil. If the sensing unit is knocked out of position, the ac system could cycle constantly or behave erratically. The sensor ought to be near the coil but not touching it; change its position by thoroughly flexing the wire that holds it in location.<p>
