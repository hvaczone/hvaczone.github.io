<h3>The Way to Pick An HVAC Company at Sulphur OK</h3>

<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take an image of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may need a recommendation later on). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Image 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
