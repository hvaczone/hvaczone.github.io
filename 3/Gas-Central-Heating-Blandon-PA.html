<p>I have been using them for several years for my businesses, my own houses and my real estate clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with different rates and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who explained to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental house. He helped me difficulty shoot the problem when I called and he recommended me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working again. He is honest, trustworthy, and affordable on rate. It's tough to discover a truthful AC guy and I'm grateful I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
