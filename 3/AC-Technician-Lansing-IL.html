<p>Advanced ventilation systems that make it possible for greater air flow from the outdoors, air quality monitoring platforms and sensors, and new air filtration technologies are becoming more common as available services in commercial and residential HVAC product bundles. Adoption of these technologies, nevertheless, has not been prevalent, as customers remain mainly oblivious to the effects of air quality on health and efficiency.<p>
