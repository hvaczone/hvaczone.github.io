<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance at Valatie NY</h3>
<p>Another method to lowering the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your house is to increase the amount of outside air coming inside. The majority of house heating and cooling systems, including forced air heating unit, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather condition allows, or running a window air conditioning system with the vent control open boosts the outside ventilation rate. Local restroom or kitchen fans that tire outdoors eliminate contaminants straight from the space where the fan lies and likewise increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
