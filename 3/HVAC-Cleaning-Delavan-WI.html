A multi-split system 56 is a standard split system, which is divided into 2 parts (evaporator and condenser) and enables cooling or heating of several rooms with one external unit.

The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the a/c individually for each room. However, now the market has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor systems run independently from each other.<p>
