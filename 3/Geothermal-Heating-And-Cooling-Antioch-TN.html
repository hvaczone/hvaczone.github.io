<p>There are a couple of possibilities to describe brief biking in very cold weather. The most apparent is the possibility of the high needs placed on the system due to the really low temperature levels. In some cases, the furnace will merely run more difficult to keep a warm environment for your house when the weather is exceptionally cold. There are other possibilities such as a crack in the heat exchanger or a broken thermostat. Contact one of our technicians if you need clarity on this issue.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air problems by including new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes give off contaminants.) However, steps such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outside air penetrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of direct exposure is through the production of an aerosol effect, many typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from poorly placed or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which often release water in an aerosol which might get in neighboring ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical facilities and assisted living home, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor fountains in public destinations. The presence of Legionella in commercial structure water products is highly under-reported, as healthy people need heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
