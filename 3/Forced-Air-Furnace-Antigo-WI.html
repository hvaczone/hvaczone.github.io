<p>Information provided in this safety guide is based upon existing scientific and technical understanding of the problems presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional boundaries developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring firms. Structures continuously progress as a result of the changes in the environment around them along with the occupants, products, and activities within them. The different surface areas and the air inside a building are continuously communicating, and this interaction leads to changes in each. For example, we might see a window as changing slightly gradually as it becomes unclean, then is cleaned, builds up dirt again, is cleaned up once again, and so on through its life. In fact, the dirt" we see might be evolving as an outcome of the interactions amongst the wetness, chemicals, and biological products found there.<p>
<p>A split air conditioning system includes two main parts - a compressor situated outside and an inside air outlet unit.
