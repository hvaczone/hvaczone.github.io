<p>The federal government suggests that homes be weatherized in order to lower the quantity of energy needed for heating & cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, actions ought to also be required to decrease contamination from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for recommended actions.) In addition, homeowners must be alert to the development of indications of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, wetness condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew growth. Additional weatherization measures must not be undertaken up until these issues have actually been fixed.<p>
<p>We take a look at ideas before we offer recommendations to change rather than repair a heater. Among the hints we look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to use, or if energy expenses are greater year after year, we understand the system is not running effectively. It may be in best condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more effective model, then you would be losing cash by not changing the older unit.<p>
<p>If the AC does not turn off, it may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't release heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can happen in time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to work till you buy a replacement-- which you should do soon.<p>
