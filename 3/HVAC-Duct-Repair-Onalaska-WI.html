<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either because of visible development or a moldy odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and preserve. Leaking return ducts can likewise present moisture. Again, if you believe a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>When the temperatures keep climbing, geothermal air conditioning is a wise and cost-effective  method to cool down your house or place of business.

At Around the Clock Air Conditioning & Heating, Inc. in Rye Brook, NY, we offer geothermal cooling repair services to commercial and residential clients alike.<p>
<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
