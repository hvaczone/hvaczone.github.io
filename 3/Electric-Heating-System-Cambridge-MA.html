<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if totally iced over.<p>
