<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one restriction: their total power needs to not go beyond the capacity of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is very typical to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units greater than the outdoor capability by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to anticipate better performance when all indoor units are switched on at the exact same time, given that the overall capability of the entire system is restricted by the capability of the outside unit. Simply put, the outside unit will disperse all its power to all running indoor systems in such a way that a few of the rooms might not have a very comfy temperature level. Nevertheless, the computation of the total power is not easy, considering that it considers not just the small power of the units, but likewise the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
