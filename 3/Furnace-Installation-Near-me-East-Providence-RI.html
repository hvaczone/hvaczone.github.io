It takes very little time to heat up or cool down the house which is among the things we didnâ $ t obtain from the one we had before. The unit hasnâ $ t required any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>

Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
