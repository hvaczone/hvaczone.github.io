<p>Packaged terminal a/c (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have 2 different units (terminal bundles), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening going through the wall and connecting them. This reduces the interior system footprint and permits each room to be changed separately. PTAC systems might be adjusted to supply heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, transforming the ac system into a heat pump While space cooling provides optimum versatility, when used to cool lots of rooms at a time it is generally more expensive than central air.<p>
