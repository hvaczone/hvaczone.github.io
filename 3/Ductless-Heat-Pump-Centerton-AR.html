<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI safeguarded.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
<p>Furthermore, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why spaces heated by radiators are prone to cold spots", implying that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and extremely hot beside the radiators. This typically leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to heat up the house escape out of the window. Radiant heat provides warmth from the flooring up throughout the room without any cold spots or stuffiness in the area being warmed.<p>
<p>Remember, too, that you might want to speak to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump units can have different heating and cooling capacities. If you currently have a home heating system, you might look for a heatpump more tailored towards cooling capability and effectiveness. For a higher-end design to look after your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally wish to search for a design that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The good news is that the one significant drawback of heatpump is that they can fail in the cold or exceptionally hot temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>
