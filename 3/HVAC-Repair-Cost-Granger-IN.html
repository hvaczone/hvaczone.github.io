If you've installed the parts revealed and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature level, and the unit doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
