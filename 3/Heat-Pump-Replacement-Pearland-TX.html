<p>Ruud air conditioners are an affordable HVAC system that uses a full lineup of cooling and heating products.

<p>A geothermal heating system does not generate its power by burning nonrenewable fuel sources such as oil, coal, or gas. Instead, it absorbs heat from within the earth. Moreover, a geothermal heating and cooling system utilizes substantially less electrical energy compared to a basic electric heat-resistance heat pump. This makes a geothermal heating unit an attractive service to cut your carbon footprint, supplying a positive effect on the environment.<p>
<p>Many central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c works but your house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
