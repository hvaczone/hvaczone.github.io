<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the whole day as they required to get rid of the old hot water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heater. We selected getting something more pricey than a traditional water heater as gas is one of our greatest energy expenditures. We feel that this brand-new system will last a long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Inspect these three things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the signs up in your house are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). The lowered air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous registers were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
