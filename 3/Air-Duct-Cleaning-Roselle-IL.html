Sources of formaldehyde in the home include building materials, smoking cigarettes, home items, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas ranges or kerosene area heating units.

Soil by highways and roads might be polluted from years of exhaust fumes from automobiles and trucks that used leaded gas. Usage door mats to wipe your feet before entering the house. Alter your clothes prior to you go house and clean these clothing independently if you work with lead in your job or a pastime.
