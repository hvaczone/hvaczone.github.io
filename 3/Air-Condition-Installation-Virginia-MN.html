<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more tough to manage than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity must be kept at or below 65%.

<p>Co2 (CO2) might not be the most pernicious factor impacting indoor air quality, but it is typically used as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more occupants there remain in a room or structure, the more CO2 is launched into the air.
