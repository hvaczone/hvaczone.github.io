<p>Chemical contaminants: Unpredictable organic compounds ( VOCs) are organic chemicals. VOCs are many, varied, and common. They consist of both human-made and naturally happening chemical compounds. Chemical pollutants can include tobacco smoke, emissions from products utilized in the building (e.g., office equipment; floor, furniture and wall coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and customer products) accidental spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>
<p>A lot of well and city water does not generally consist of lead. Water usually gets lead inside the house from household plumbing that is made with lead materials. If there is lead in drinking water is to have it evaluated, the only way to understand. Contact the local health department or the water provider to learn how to get the water evaluated. Send out for the EPA pamphlet, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for more information about what you can do if you have actually lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for more details.<p>
<p>Irritants are materials that cause an immune-type reaction in individuals who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants found in indoor air are primarily biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these products are little particles, can end up being air-borne, and thus, are quickly inhaled. Allergens that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For example, if you think about a group of people with asthma, the presence of cat allergen might cause an asthma attack in individuals with feline allergies, but not in those people who do not have feline allergic reactions.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's providing the service contract tries to upsell you whenever they come to perform regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be showing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount if she restored her PMA for 7 years, despite the fact that it was 6 months prior to the present one expired. She didn't need a air purification system, however they talked her into it.<p>
