<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you need to look out for. First, you ought to check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
