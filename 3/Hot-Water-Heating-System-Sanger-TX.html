<p>Among the disadvantages of central heating is that it's possibly expensive to set up, particularly in an older house. Depending on the kind of system installed, it can be noisy and trigger problems if you're extremely allergic to dust. In addition, particular fuels and equipment may need unique licenses, and there is minimal flexibility in the event of altered heating requirements. Throughout usage, there is a time delay while heat is being transported from the heating system to the home.<p>

<p>There is no simple response, but lots of use the rule of thumb that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, changing is most likely a better option. If the existing system has not incurred other significant repairs, remains in otherwise outstanding condition, and concerns that resulted in the breakdown can be determined and remedied, repairing the system can make a lot of sense too.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality problems. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in sufficient outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
