Take some time to inspect these parts for dust and damage, making sure that they are tight and safe.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan.

Unscrew the old AC contactor prior to getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Picture 6).<p>

<p>I typically don't leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my options. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss alternatives. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>
