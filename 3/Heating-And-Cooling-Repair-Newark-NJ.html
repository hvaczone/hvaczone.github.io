<p>During regular furnace operation, dust, dirt, moisture from humidity or condensation, and microbial developments can develop on internal elements. Airborne components from regular home products and surfaces can cause formicary rust within your HVAC devices. Left unattended, these issues can lead to loss of efficiency and worse, breakdown of element materials and a shorter furnace life-span In time, important parts like the heat exchanger, burners or blower housing can begin corroding, leading to minimized efficiency.<p>
<p>Outside contaminants. Outside particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a house. Particulates and irritants discovered in outside air can be asthma triggers. Filtering inbound air for HVAC systems efficiently filters particulates.
