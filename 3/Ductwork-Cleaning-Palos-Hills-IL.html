A building walk-through to look for odors and search for water damage, leakages, dirt or bug droppings may be helpful. Leaks need to be removed. Standing water in humidifiers, cooling systems, on roofings and in boiler pans can become polluted with fungi or germs and need to be gotten rid of, also. In some circumstances, specific screening for radon or for asbestos may be required as part of structure occupancy.
