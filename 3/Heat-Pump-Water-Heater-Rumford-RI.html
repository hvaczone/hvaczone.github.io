Pre-owned smoke is likewise hazardous to people, particularly children.<p>
<p>A blocked furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most typical cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too quickly, and your house won't warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A dirty filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
