<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices typically lasts decades, given that it is secured inside your home. When it does need to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most pricey to install. New technical standards get rid of the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some poorly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground with time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in buildings with poor IAQ may see unpleasant or musty odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are worsening, speak to your physician about them. But not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no substitute for great structure management.<p>
