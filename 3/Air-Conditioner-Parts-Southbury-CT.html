<p>Terrific Item! Shipment was sort of unusual being that package was opened and products might have fell out. However after review of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The product was extremely lite weight and takes time to apply. Note: purchase advised non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to see the video first prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with assistance, we resolved issues. I would suggest this item to anybody who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>

<p>We look at clues before we offer advice to change instead of repair a heating system. One of the clues we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to use, or if energy expenses are higher every year, we know the unit is not running effectively. It may be in best condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more effective model, then you would be squandering money by not changing the older unit.<p>
<p>I am really amazed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years back and understand the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise pleased that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
