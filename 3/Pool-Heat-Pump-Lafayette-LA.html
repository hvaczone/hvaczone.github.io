<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires before detaching anything (you might need a recommendation later on). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
