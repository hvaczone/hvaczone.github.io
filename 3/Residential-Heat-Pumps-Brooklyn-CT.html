An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the billing prior to work began.

<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may need a referral later). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4).

The female crimp ports need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually switched all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
