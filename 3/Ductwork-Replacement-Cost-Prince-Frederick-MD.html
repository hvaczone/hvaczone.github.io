Whether it's maintenance, repair, furnace, or air conditioning installation, neither one remembers discovering the trade it simply came naturally. A structure like that and an enthusiasm to do the right thing is what makes our company what it is today.

<p>Installation includes digging deep holes or long trenches to set up the pipelines, so it's labor-intensive on the front end. Nevertheless, you'll conserve money over the long term because of the lower energy expenses. Likewise, a geothermal system tends to last about two times as long as conventional air-source systems. The lack of moving parts implies you're less likely to spend big on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be expected to last for 50 years. They're substantially more efficient then even the highest-efficiency air source units.<p>
