<p>A geothermal heating unit does not generate its power by burning nonrenewable fuel sources such as coal, gas, or oil. Rather, it soaks up heat from within the earth.

<p>Similar to the majority of home enhancement projects, the cost of a full central heater can differ widely based on the size of the home. Most heating systems will last between 15 and 20 years. In picking a furnace, homeowner need to consider heat output and efficiency. Heat output is measured in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace ought to be matched to the size of the home. A little home, for example, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the home too quickly and turn off for too long, resulting in inconsistent temperature levels.<p>
