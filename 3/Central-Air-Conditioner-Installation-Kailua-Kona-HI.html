<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in structures through mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
