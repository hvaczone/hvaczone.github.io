<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you should check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
