<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job finding the outdoor system as near to your house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.)
