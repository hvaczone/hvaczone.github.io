<p>I typically don't leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not anticipate needing to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my choices. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about choices. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>Brian was every bit honest, enjoyable and responsive. Jeremiah Bartula the plumbing professional discussed our options prior to our work with Brian and was amazing, helpful and helpful - his work was remarkable! All of his assistants were courteous and conscientious. The work site was left entirely cleared and cleaned. We would extremely motivate others to go right to Berkshire Heating and Air Conditioning for all their heating and cooling needs.<p>
