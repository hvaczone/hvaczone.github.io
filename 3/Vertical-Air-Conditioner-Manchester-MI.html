<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you must watch out for. First, you should inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
