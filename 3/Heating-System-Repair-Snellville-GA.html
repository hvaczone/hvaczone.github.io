<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. When I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the cost terrific but Mark headed out of his method to tailor a few things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
