<h3>Ductwork Repair and Replacement in Ocoee Florida</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
