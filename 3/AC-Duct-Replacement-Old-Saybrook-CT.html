<p>How environment modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for modern air conditioning unit) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c boost. This increase has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner removes that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c should increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the a/c has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
