<p>Professional heater setups. However, even the best-maintained heater will eventually stop working. HVAC specialists recommend following this basic guideline when choosing whether it deserves investing in a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the cost of a new system, it's best to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have much more years left in it, and it's most likely to be utilizing more energy than essential.<p>
<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were very popular in the very first half of the 20th century, especially in commercial buildings, apartment buildings and very large homes. Numerous steam and radiator boiler systems set up more than 50 years ago stay operable, due to the fact that the lack of moving parts makes them less vulnerable to tear and wear. A steam boiler replacement expenses between $4,000 and $30,000, depending on boiler size.<p>
