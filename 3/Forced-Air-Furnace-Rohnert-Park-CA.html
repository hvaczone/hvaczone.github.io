For a long time I dismissed him but then I understood that it truly didnâ $ t distribute air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly think of anything else other than changing it. The one I got deserves every cent. The sound level is itâ and low $ s great on energy saving too.<p>
