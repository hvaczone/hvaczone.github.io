<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. When they laid a network of pipelines under their marble floors and connected them into a hot water supply, radiant heat systems have been around because the days of the Romans. Romans used a wood-fired boiler tended by servants and a primary pumping machine to circulate hot water that warmed their stone floorings. In turn, the harmony of the floor heat transferred heat to other posts in the rooms, including the human residents.<p>
<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are typically referred to as merely glowing systems. Electric radiant heat systems have actually heating elements installed in the subfloor of each room in the home, occasionally linked to terminal systems like baseboard heaters. When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the approach is referred to as radiant heat.<p>

<p>I normally do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my alternatives. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about choices. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household friend and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
