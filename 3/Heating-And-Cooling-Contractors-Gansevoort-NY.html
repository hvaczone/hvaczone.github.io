<p>Award Winning Pipes and HVAC Services. Many common building materials utilized before 1975 include asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heater, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products.

<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
