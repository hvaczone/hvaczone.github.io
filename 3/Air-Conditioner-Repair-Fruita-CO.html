<p>A/c can also be supplied by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its efficiency.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. While doing so, heat is absorbed from inside your home and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the like geothermal energy though, and the two must not be puzzled. Where a geothermal HVAC use the heat inside the earth for area heating, cooling or for heating one's water system, geothermal energy is the process by which the heat inside the earth is utilized for generating power in the form of electrical energy. The two operations use different procedures, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated to boiling point to achieve its objectives.<p>
