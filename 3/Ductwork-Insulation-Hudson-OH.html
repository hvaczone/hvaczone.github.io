Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was definitely appreciative to have a heated home again. What's most fantastic was that this all happened during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find somebody to help us right prior to a vacation, however Environment Pro came through for us. I will gladly advise this company to my good friends.<p>

My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
