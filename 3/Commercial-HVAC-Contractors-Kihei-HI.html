Nevertheless, in the United States, as in other countries, regulative development mostly stops at the entrance.

<p>For example, issues arise when, in an effort to conserve energy, ventilation systems are not used to generate adequate amounts of outdoor air.

Incorrectly located outdoor air intake vents can likewise bring in air polluted with vehicle and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from bathrooms.
