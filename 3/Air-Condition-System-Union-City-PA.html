<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (most of the times) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
