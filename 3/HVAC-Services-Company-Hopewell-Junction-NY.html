<h3>What You Will Need to Know About Air Conditioner Repair at Hopewell Junction NY</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transferring the soaked up heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression procedure. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>

<p>The predominant health effect related to exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your threat of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
