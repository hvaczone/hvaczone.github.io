Nevertheless, much of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
