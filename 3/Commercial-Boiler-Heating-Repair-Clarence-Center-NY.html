<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
