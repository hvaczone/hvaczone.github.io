<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his staff members, devices costs, marketing, utilities, and other costs before paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not sound like much, specifically if the objective of owning a company was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it took to build business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% normally isn't the end goal. HVAC business owners must pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their revenues while keeping costs the same in all other locations.<p>
