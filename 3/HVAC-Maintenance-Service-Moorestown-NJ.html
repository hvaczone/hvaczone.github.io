<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often referred to as just radiant systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating components installed in the subfloor of each room in the home, periodically connected to terminal units like baseboard heating units. When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the flooring, and into the room. This is why the technique is described as radiant heat.<p>
