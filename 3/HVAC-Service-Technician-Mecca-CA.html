<p>If you seem like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you might not have an issue as long as your house still warms to the ideal temperature. The temperature level of the air produced by the heat pump will not necessarily be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it may not feel really hot.

<p>Legionella is a parasite of protozoans such as amoeba, and therefore needs conditions ideal for both organisms.

<h3>Advantages of Pre-Insulated Duct Systems in Mecca CA</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
