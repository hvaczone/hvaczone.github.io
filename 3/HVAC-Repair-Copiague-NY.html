<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer malfunctions, your Nest won't come on. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security changes that secure your air conditioning system from flooding. One of the most typical areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan.
