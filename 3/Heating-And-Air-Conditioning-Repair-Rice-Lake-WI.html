My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
