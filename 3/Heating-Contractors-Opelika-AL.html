<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not provide car debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in monthly, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to use auto debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract..
