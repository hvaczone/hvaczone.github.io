<p>People operating in buildings with bad IAQ may observe unpleasant or musty smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not going away or are becoming worse, talk with your physician about them. But not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no replacement for great structure management.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture, Air cleaning takes place. The objective is to provide adequate modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to accomplish this. A common component essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
