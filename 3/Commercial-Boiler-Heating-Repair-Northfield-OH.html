<p>It might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not give off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can take place in time since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts.
