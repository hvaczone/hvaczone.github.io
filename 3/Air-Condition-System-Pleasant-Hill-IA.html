<p>And it's not simply downtown high- and mid-rise houses bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has enjoyed the single-family home installation organisation totally flip on its head the last couple of years. Winter used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer season, with their typically two-week AC installation wait times swelling to approximately 3 months.

<p>It is common to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable in time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical material in time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
