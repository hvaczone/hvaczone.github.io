<p>A ducted heat pump appears like a big central air conditioner unit that sits outside your home. Heatpump run on electrical power and work like air conditioners in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air.

<p>You're most likely hearing the fan motor attempting to start without the boost it needs from the capacitor if you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz. You can often conclude that the capacitor has failed. In some cases you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pushing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. However the opportunities are good that this may work for one cycle, however the capacitor will fail next time the AC goes on. It's best to replace the capacitor.<p>
