The Guideline prohibited using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that equipment that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
