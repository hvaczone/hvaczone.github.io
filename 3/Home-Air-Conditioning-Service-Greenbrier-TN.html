<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
