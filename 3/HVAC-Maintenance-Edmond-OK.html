<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you would not use them.  Second of all like prolonged auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the needed abilities to do the task and also the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. Many companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to properly service and the system has actually been operating problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
