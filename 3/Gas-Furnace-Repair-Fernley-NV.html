<p>I have been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a hard task that the workers sweat and bleed at, specifically residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with customers and keeps men working. When a sales man concerns your home he exists to offer, that is the only method he is paid. You have a great Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and should not "need" to sell you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I give you the options for your requirements and you decide if you require it.<p>

<h3>Average HVAC Services Offered with a Fernley NV HVAC Company</h3>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a relatively easy to determine surrogate for indoor toxins emitted by human beings, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are unusually high inside your home might trigger occupants to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are typically 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level thought about acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Human beings are the primary indoor source of co2 in many buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are a sign of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is normally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
