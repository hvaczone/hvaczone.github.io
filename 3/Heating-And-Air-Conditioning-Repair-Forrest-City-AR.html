<p>EER stands for Energy Performance Ratio. The energy performance of central air units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a traditional system of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.
