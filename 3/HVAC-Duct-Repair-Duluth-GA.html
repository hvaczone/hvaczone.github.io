<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the average house. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, often described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the incoming air is reduced, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the entering air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite considerable if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
<p>Occupational exposure limits use dose-response data which show the health results of repeated exposure to one specific chemical. Similar information is not readily available for long-lasting, low-level exposures to a mix of impurities as holds true for IAQ issues. Presently, there is inadequate details readily available to anticipate the results of exposure to a number of potentially damaging agents at the very same time.<p>
