<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts airflows and contaminant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic interface that allows the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system parts, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>

Integrity isn't simply their name, its an organisation design they take seriously. You men are formally on speed dial. Talk to you soon.<p>
