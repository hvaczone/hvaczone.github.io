<h3>Working of an HVAC System at Rye NY</h3>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a reasonably simple to measure surrogate for indoor pollutants produced by human beings, and associates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are unusually high indoors might trigger occupants to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are usually 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level thought about acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 People are the main indoor source of carbon dioxide in a lot of buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
