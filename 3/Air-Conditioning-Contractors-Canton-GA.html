<p>The quality of the air inside our offices, schools and houses matters, particularly considering that we spend most of our lives indoors. Air conditioning system help to dehumidify the incoming air, but in extremely damp climates or in cases where the a/c is large, it might not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the ac system will require more energy to cool your home. A more suitable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
<p>A regular furnace tune up can make the most of performance and offer longer long lasting home heating. Nevertheless, there are times when a basic maintenance call can recognize an issue that will need a considerable investment to fix. Then, it's choice time. Do you make the pricey repair and enjoy ongoing comfort from your present heater? Or, do you make an even bigger financial commitment to changing the furnace?

In a scenario where there is visible mold and the indoor air quality might have been compromised, mold remediation may be needed.
