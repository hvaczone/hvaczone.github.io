<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Properly maintained heating equipment can last for years. But if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel bills unexpectedly appear higher than typical, it is probably time to consider a brand-new system. New heating devices is much more efficient-- you'll see lower fuel bills right away, not to discuss the cash you'll save on repair costs. If your heater is 25 years old or more, you can most likely expect to cut your fuel bills in half.<p>

<p>New a/c unit typically vary from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A greater SEER score implies higher energy effectiveness and possibly lower energy expenses.

It's not constantly about picking the design with the highest SEER rating, it's finding the one that's right for you. This is where your dealer can help.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer season air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
