<h3>AC Maintenance Cost in Millington Tennessee</h3>

<p>Reinstall the gain access to panel and disconnect block. Switch on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and await the AC to begin (see Be Patient at Startup," below). The compressor ought to run and the condenser fan ought to spin. The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor starts but the fan does not. Turn off the power and eliminate the screws around the condenser cover.

Then see and repower the unit if the fan starts. , if it doesn't, you've given it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
