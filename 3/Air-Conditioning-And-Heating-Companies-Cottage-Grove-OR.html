<p>All houses need efficient ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has been stressed out from use.

Heating systems that kick on often may be because of an unclean filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal concern. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or perhaps a dirty burner.<p>
