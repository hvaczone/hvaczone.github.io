When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the conventional hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the traditional water heater.
