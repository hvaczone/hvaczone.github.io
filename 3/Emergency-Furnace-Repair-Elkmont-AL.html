<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, employees attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system creates more difficulties, because some of indoor systems can be situated far from the exterior. The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the cooling separately for each room. However, now the marketplace has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor systems operate individually from each other.<p>
