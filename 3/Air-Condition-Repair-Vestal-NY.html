<h3>Preventive HVAC Care in Vestal NY</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, performed a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by enhancing airflow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no substantial improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy performance. In many cases, determined particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
