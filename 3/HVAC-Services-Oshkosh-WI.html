<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his staff members, equipment costs, marketing, energies, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not seem like much, especially if the goal of owning a company was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% wants the couple of years it required to develop the business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% typically isn't the end objective. HVAC entrepreneur should pursue 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their revenues while keeping expenses the very same in all other locations.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
