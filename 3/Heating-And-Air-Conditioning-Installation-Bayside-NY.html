On those days when you just can't seem to warm up and find you need to show up your thermostat, your furnace can draw all the humidity out of your house and leave your sinuses throbbing.

Never ever utilize a gas stove to heat your home. Constantly make sure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace remains in use.<p>
