<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outdoors - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. Connection problems along the line that provides power to your furnace can jeopardize the performance of the system. Loose, defective or missing wires will cause the thermostat to lose its connection to the unit and interrupt service. Part of preserving your furnace includes checking the suggested connections as well as temperature level and pressure determines. Take time to inspect these parts for dust and damage, making sure that they are secure and tight.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up regularly, they can end up being clogged with debris that can restrict air flow, potentially affecting your convenience and your system's efficiency. Dirty filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace parts and in more severe cases trigger the system to close down entirely. By comparison, examining and changing a furnace filter can generally be done in simply a couple of minutes, frequently with no tools needed. As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
