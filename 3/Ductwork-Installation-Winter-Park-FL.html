<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>I generally don't leave evaluations however wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to change your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my choices. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over options. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>

<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They give me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a brand-new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged warranties or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not need.<p>
