A preferable option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be added as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit many companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash coming in each month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to provide auto debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There need to not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>
