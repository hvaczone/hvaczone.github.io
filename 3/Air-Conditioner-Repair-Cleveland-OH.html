<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure co2 need to be adjusted often, and outside measurements utilized for computations must be made close in time to indoor measurements.
