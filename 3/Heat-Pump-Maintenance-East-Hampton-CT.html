Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 house has a distinct DNA on how it accumulates dust and dirt. It takes about six months of close observation to see how frequently your air conditioning filter collects dirt and dust. After that, you can make a much better right choice on how typically your HVAC filters need changing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 houses have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 house, the less frequently you'll need to clean them.
