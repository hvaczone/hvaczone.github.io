Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire.

This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical product over time.
