Carbon dioxide at levels that are abnormally high inside may cause residents to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are generally 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level thought about acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the primary indoor source of co2 in many structures.

The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs.
