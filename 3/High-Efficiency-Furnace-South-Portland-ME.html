<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in South Portland ME</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Inspect these three things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the registers in your house are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The minimized air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
