Yearly furnace service may also be a requirement to keep your furnace warranty valid as well.

<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take a photo of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might need a recommendation later). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Eliminate the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
