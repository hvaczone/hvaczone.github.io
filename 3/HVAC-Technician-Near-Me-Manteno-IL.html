<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Suitable Duct Sealing in Manteno IL</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went terrific. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the entire day as they required to eliminate the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heater. We chose getting something more costly than a conventional hot water heater as gas is among our most significant energy expenses. We feel that this new unit will last a long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He knew simply what the problem was and fixed it extremely quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
