<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should momentarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
