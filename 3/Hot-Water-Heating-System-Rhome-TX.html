Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
