<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>There are a couple of possibilities to describe brief cycling in very cold weather. The most obvious is the possibility of the high demands placed on the system due to the extremely low temperatures. Sometimes, the furnace will just run more difficult to preserve a warm environment for your home when the weather condition is exceptionally cold. There are other possibilities such as a fracture in the heat exchanger or a damaged thermostat. If you need clearness on this issue, contact one of our professionals.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air problems by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes release toxins.) However, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
