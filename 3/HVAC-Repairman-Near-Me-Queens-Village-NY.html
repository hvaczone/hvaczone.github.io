<p>Integrity Energy was quick to respond when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our two heating systems were not working. They showed up the next day and changed 2 heaters and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday until the brand-new furnaces can heat your house. Honestly, our home heating unit is made complex, Rob and his team fixed the old duct, changed all the dampers, make the entire system work completely.<p>
<p>As pointed out above, activating your new under tile flooring heater too soon, before the mortar has actually cured, can trigger the grout to split or to not adhere properly, and might void the service warranty of your mortar item. In some screening, even the tile cracked when the system was run before the compound had actually cured. And mortar manufacturers may refuse service warranty protection if you do not follow their guidelines.<p>
