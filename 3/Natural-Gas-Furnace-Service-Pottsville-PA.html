<p>While pollutant levels from individual sources may not position a substantial health risk on their own, a lot of homes have more than one source that adds to indoor air pollution. There can be a serious danger from the cumulative impacts of these sources. Fortunately, there are steps that most people can take both to lower the threat from existing sources and to avoid new issues from taking place. This safety guide was prepared by the U.S. Epa (EPA) and the U.S. Customer Item Safety Commission (CPSC) to assist you decide whether to do something about it that can decrease the level of indoor air pollution in your own house.<p>
<p>Immediate impacts may show up after a single direct exposure or repeated direct exposures. These include inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such instant results are treatable and typically short-term. In some cases the treatment is just getting rid of the person's exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be determined. Signs of some illness, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might likewise appear not long after exposure to some indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air issues by including brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases discharge contaminants.) However, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outside air infiltrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Biological impurities include bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are sent by people and animals; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. It can become air-borne when it dries. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these impurities through the home.<p>
