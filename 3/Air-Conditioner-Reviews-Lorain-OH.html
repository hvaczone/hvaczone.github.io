<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not use automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in monthly, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use auto debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There ought to not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
