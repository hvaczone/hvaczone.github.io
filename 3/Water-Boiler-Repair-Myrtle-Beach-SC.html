<p>If you think a mold issue-- either because of noticeable development or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source.

Leaky return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Once again, if you suspect a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
