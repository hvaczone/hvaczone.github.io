<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pressing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your exposure to this chemical is prudent.

If products with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent visits, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
