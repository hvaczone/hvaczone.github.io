<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes release pollutants.) Nevertheless, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the quantity of outside air penetrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>If you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas space heater, consider possible results of indoor air contamination. Follow the maker's directions, specifically instructions on the correct fuel and keeping the heating system properly adjusted. A relentless yellow-tipped flame is normally a sign of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While an area heater remains in use, open a door from the space where the heating system is located to the rest of the home and open a window a little.<p>
