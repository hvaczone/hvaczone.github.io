<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you would not offer them.. Second of all like extended car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the essential abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to treat consumers relatively. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely made the most of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly found someone to appropriately service and the system has been operating problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also changes functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
