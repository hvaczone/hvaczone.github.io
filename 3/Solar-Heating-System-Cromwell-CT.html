VOCs (volatile organic substances) from paint and even from some sort of carpeting and upholstery products can cause problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be offenders, too.<p>
<p>Current Review: They were fantastic! So many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally requested. They fulfilled my needs entirely by providing an expert quote with options, without pressing extra products. The team showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also without delay followed up with the needed examinations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely recommend this company.<p>
