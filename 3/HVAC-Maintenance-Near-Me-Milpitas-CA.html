<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
