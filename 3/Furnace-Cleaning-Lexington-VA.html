<p>Most central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning system works but your house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
