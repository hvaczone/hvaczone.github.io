You might look for a heat pump more tailored towards cooling capability and efficiency if you already have a home heating system.

<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high enough temperature level, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be warmed without coming in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct work, supplying warm air to specific bedrooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
