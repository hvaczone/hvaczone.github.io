<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- give All Vovo a call! Heatpump work very well in temperate climates like King and South Snohomish counties. Operating on electrical power, a heatpump is an economical service utilizing a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your fridge, but in reverse. Instead of warming or cooling the air currently inside your home, it draws heat or cool from the air outside and presses it through the ventilation system of your home.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to locate the heat source at the floor level. This lets the warmth naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head location. All things in the hot zone reach equilibrium in temperature after the radiant heat system has been operating for a while, including individuals. When the furnace kicks in and that abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<p>It can be the best time to conceptualize innovative approaches for promoting your HVAC company as well when business is less busy.

<p>G&S did an outstanding job installing our new furnace and AC system. The very best feature of G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers guarantee would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their warranty. Likewise they diagnosed the issue and fixed very quickly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more difficult to manage than they seem due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity must be maintained at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to minimize mold growth.<p>
<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution. For example, people exhale co2, which in small amounts is not poisonous, but may end up being harmful if high concentrations are allowed to collect. Germs or micro-organisms may likewise exist within the ventilation system. They might spread throughout the whole workplace or structure by means of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do establish.<p>
