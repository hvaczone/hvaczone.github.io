<p>I am a real estate investor, I need to replace two heaters in a 8000square foot house. Some sources, such as building products, furnishings and items like air fresheners, can release pollutants more or less continuously.

Malfunctioning or unvented devices or poorly used items can release higher and sometimes unsafe levels of contaminants inside.<p>
<p>There are many actions a house owner can take to choose products that will prevent indoor air problems from happening - a number of them are pointed out here. First, use exterior-grade pressed wood products made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floors, kitchen cabinetry, and wall surfaces. Or, as an alternative, consider utilizing strong wood items. Secondly, if you plan to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements, make certain that an efficient wetness barrier is installed prior to installing the carpet. If it becomes wet, do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be eliminated.<p>
