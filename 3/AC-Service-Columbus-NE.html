<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>

It protects the environment from damaging digging, fracking, or contaminants because the energy utilized to heat your home is drawn out straight from the ground.

<p>I am changing our High Velocity System because of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted equipment, a Carrier, Comfort Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also setting up an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding three (3) high velocity supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will likewise recycle the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will likewise set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I likewise have a choice for an additional $2,818.00 to set up a Provider Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>Lots of individuals are becoming more concerned and aware about their health and the effect of indoor air quality. Dust and dirt consisting of pollutants and allergens can cover the a/c ductwork with time.

<p>As many of you discussed, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment manufacturer's to guarantee your factory warranties remain in location. Furthermore, the concrete results of a PM is frequently difficult to measure, as one action mentioned the cost savings in efficiency or repairs that were avoided. Many pieces of a furnace or a/c do not simply break at the breeze of a finger, but instead is the outcome of repeated use of a component that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger may fail too soon since the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and causing premature degeneration, causing fractures and holes. If that customer had received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and secures the element.  a very advantageous outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a client thousands.<p>
