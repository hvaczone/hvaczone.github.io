<h3>The Way to Select An Expert HVAC Technician in Pendleton SC</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, sending the absorbed heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression procedure. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>

Not just can our winters get pretty chilly, our summers turn right back around and offer sweltering days in which going without a quality a/c unit is unimaginable.
