<p>If no pollutant sources are discovered, it is still possible that an indoor air pollution issue exists. Excessive re-circulation of air causes "stale air" conditions. Stagnant air has greater levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air. When ventilation is not enough to account for an increase in the number of workers in the area, stale air may also be an issue.<p>

As HVAC service technicians frequently enter contact with electrical wiring, they run the risk of being electrocuted. They can also suffer other kinds of abrasions and burns to the skin.
