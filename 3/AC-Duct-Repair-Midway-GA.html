<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly described as "reverse cycle ac system". The heatpump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy.
