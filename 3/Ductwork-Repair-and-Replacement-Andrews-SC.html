<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you must examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
