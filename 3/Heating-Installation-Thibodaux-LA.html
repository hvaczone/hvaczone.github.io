While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart house owner, it's still needed to have a professional technician inspect the system regularly.<p>
<p>Individuals working in buildings with poor IAQ might notice undesirable or moldy odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are worsening, speak to your medical professional about them. But not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no alternative to good building management.<p>

You'll specify your company's mission, plainly explaining your company's function and problems it looks for to resolve, your target market and customers, and your unique selling proposal (what makes you stand apart from the competitors). You need to also discuss your company's management team and how you define and measure success.<p>
