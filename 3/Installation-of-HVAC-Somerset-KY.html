<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance at Somerset KY</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transferring the absorbed heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating system.<p>

The 2 operations utilize various procedures, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated up to boiling point to achieve its aims.<p>
