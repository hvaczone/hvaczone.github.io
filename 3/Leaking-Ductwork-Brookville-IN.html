<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Style, Building and Commissioning is developed for architects, style engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other specialists interested in indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the home consist of building products, smoking cigarettes, home products, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning home appliances, like gas stoves or kerosene space heaters. Formaldehyde, by itself or in mix with other chemicals, serves a variety of purposes in made products. For instance, it is used to add permanent-press qualities to clothing and drapes, as an element of glues and adhesives, and as a preservative in some paints and finish items.<p>
<p>More common in relatively older homes, a boiler-based heating system utilizes electricity, gas or oil to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipes to heat radiators in individual rooms. All-electric boilers can accomplish up to 95 to one hundred percent AFUE, according to the DOE. More recent gas boilers should accomplish 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers need to accomplish a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
