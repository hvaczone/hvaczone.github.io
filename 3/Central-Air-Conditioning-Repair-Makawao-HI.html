Compared to older models, which may be rated as low as 80% performance, this can indicate significant cost savings in yearly heating costs. Modern 2- and three-stage heating systems increase efficiency even further by performing at lower or higher capacity depending upon the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>Geothermal heatpump can be easily integrated with existing systems such as standard forced air or glowing floor heating or can be set up in a new structure.

The size of geothermal heatpump and the size of ground loop needed depends upon the heating & cooling requirements for your house and is vital iin ensuring the performance and performance of the system. Capability for geothermal systems is determined in loads. Usually, a 3-ton setup needs to be sufficient for the average home, but home size, heating and cooling needs, local geology and soil, and land schedule are all aspects which will influence the right size for your specific house.
