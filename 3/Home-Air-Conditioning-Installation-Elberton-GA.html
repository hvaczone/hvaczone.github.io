<h3>Have Your HVAC System Serviced Annually in Elberton GA</h3>
<p>Most people don't know how humidity is removed from your Houston Midtown Tx house. The evaporator HVAC coil in your attic likewise acts a dehumidifier. All the wet hot air that goes through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then eliminated from the space that is being cooled. If your HVAC system is not draining effectively, you'll have a water leak. A constraint in your drainage pipelines causes a water leak. There are several places an obstruction can happen. Among the primary locations where clogs begin to develop is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
