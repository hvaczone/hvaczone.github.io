Some sources, such as developing products, home furnishings and products like air fresheners, can launch pollutants more or less constantly. Other sources, associated to activities like smoking cigarettes, cleaning, redecorating or doing hobblies release pollutants intermittently. Malfunctioning or unvented devices or improperly utilized products can launch greater and sometimes dangerous levels of contaminants indoors.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which anticipates air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system elements, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in big residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
