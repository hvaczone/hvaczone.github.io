<p>Radiant heat covers a range of different heater, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems operate on comparable principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats by dispersing hot water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the warm water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the space.<p>
