<h3>Locating Greatest HVAC Contractors in Merrill WI</h3>
<p>All modern-day cooling systems, even small window bundle systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be changed or cleaned as conditions require. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Additionally, very filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
