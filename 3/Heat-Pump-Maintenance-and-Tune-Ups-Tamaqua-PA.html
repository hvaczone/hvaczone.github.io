<p>Current Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time.

I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
