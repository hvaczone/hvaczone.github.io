<p>The main issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, workers attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system produces more difficulties, because some of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the cooling separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor units operate individually from each other.<p>

<p>Another alternative to oil heaters are gas furnaces While oil is traditionally used in areas where gas lines do not run, there are times when you may have a choice between the 2 types. Gas furnaces cost about the exact same, roughly $6,000 for a high-efficiency system. The real advantage of utilizing a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your home. Heating with gas costs around $540 a year, instead of the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>
