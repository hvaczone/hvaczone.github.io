<p>I have been utilizing them for many years for my businesses, my own houses and my realty customers' houses. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with various rates and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who discussed to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental home. When I called and he advised me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working again, he helped me trouble shoot the problem. He is honest, trusted, and affordable on price. It's tough to discover a sincere AC person and I'm thankful I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
