<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
