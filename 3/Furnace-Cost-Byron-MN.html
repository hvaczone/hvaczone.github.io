Since it just takes more electricity to run a larger unit, a large-scale compressor likewise costs more to run. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity efficiently. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down prior to it has an opportunity to distribute the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary wetness. The result is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature shows. In truth, the room can feel moist and clammy.<p>
