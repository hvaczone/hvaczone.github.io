He knew simply what the issue was and repaired it extremely rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
