<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives ask for assessment and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. However, much of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation.
