<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the same.

<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical material with time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
