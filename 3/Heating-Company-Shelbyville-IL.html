<p>Measurement treatments are being developed and shown to assess building ventilation and indoor contaminant concentrations. These procedures range from advanced tracer gas approaches utilized primarily in building research efforts to less involved procedures that can be used by building operators.

<p>Insufficient maintenance of the HVAC system also might contribute to indoor air quality issues. Ventilation system filters that are not changed regularly may end up being blocked, decreasing air flow distribution, quality, and volume.

Humidifier systems on HVAC systems also must be properly maintained to avoid bacteria and mold contamination.<p>

Follow the manufacturer's instructions, especially instructions on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heater correctly changed. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is typically an indicator of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While an area heating system remains in use, open a door from the room where the heating system is located to the remainder of the home and open a window somewhat.<p>
