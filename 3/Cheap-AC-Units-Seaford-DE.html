<p>. Prior to selecting the installation area of air conditioner, a number of primary aspects need to be considered. First of all, the direction of air circulation from the indoor units need to not fall on the place of rest or workspace.

The outdoor system must also be located in an open space, otherwise the heat from the house will not be efficiently discharged outside and the productivity of the entire system will drop dramatically. It is highly advisable to install the air conditioner units in easily accessible places, for further maintenance throughout operation.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you should look out for. First, you should examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
