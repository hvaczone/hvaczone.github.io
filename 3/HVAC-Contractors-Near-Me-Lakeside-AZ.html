They consist of hold-ups in physical and mental advancement, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Children, fetuses, and infants are more susceptible to lead exposure than grownups considering that lead is more easily taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more sensitive to the destructive results of lead. Kids may have greater direct exposures since they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>

<p>Lead has long been recognized as a hazardous toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " top ecological danger to the health of children in the United States." There are many methods which human beings are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, degrading paint, and dust. Airborne lead goes into the body when a specific breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled. Before it was known how damaging lead could be, it was utilized in paint, gasoline, pipes, and lots of other items.<p>
<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was really practical in collecting information on the phone and supplying clear guidelines about how to temporarily cope with the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and offered clear interaction about the issue, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly use Stability Energy Systems once again, for office and home.<p>
