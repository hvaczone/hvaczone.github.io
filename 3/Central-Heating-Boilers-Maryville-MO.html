<p>It prevails to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as fairly the same physical material with time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
