<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment usually lasts years, considering that it is secured indoors. When it does need to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most expensive to install. New technical guidelines eliminate the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground with time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>
<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO maintain the effectiveness and performance of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, select your contractor wisely, many of the 'credible' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales methods that DO take advantage of uninformed property owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a trustworthy company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a comparable ranking are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Ventilation plays a crucial function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of processes which leads to the supply and removal of air from inside a structure." Those procedures consist of generating outside air, conditioning it and blending it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the building, and moving some part of indoor air exterior. If one or more of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be affected.<p>
