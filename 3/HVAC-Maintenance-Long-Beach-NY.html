<p>Truth: Geothermal systems really consume no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that exact same aquifer.

Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage.
