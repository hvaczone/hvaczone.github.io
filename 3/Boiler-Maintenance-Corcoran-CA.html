Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
