First, use exterior-grade pressed wood products made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floorings, cabinetry, and wall surfaces. Or, as an alternative, consider utilizing strong wood products. Secondly, if you prepare to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements, make sure that an efficient wetness barrier is installed prior to installing the carpet.
