<h3>The Annals of Air Source Heat Pumps in Collegeville PA</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things initially. Make sure all the registers in your house are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Image 2). The minimized air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous registers were closed or the filter was blocked. If you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's great air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
