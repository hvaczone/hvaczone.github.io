Other's experiences with the company can respond to these and many other questions.<p>
<p>Rising energy costs are not the only reason for high bills. Heating systems often lose their effectiveness as they age, particularly if they have not been appropriately maintained.

Start to compare the cost of your recent heating costs with heating costs from the previous years. It's time to replace your furnace if there is a substantial distinction.<p>

The heat pump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
