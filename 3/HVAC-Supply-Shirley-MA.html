<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, conducted a research study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by improving airflow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy efficiency. In many cases, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
