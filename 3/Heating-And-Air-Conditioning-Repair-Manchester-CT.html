Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems effectively filters particulates.

We have the experience and resources essential to help from the planning phases through to the final installation.

<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these three things initially. Ensure all the signs up in your house are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The decreased air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's great air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the issue.<p>
