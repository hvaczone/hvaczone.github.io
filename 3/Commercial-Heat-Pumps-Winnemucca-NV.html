I feel like they offer me preferential treatment, and want to pay a little more for that assurance.<p>

<h3>Installation of HVAC in Winnemucca NV 89445</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have become aware of the $5000 rule however got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
