<p>Move the thermostat setting to heat." A furnace can be daunting-- particularly when the heat won't switch on. However, there is good news from furnace repair pros.

<p>When setting up the entire system, geothermal heat pump cost is far more than other heat pump types. Geothermal systems need underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy.

<p>Most central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system.

The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning unit works however your house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
