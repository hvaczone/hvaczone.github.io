<p>It prevails to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady over time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably the same physical product in time.

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
