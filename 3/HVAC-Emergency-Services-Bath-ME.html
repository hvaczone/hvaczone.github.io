<p>It is common to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product with time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
