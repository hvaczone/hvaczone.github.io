<p>Radiant heating includes setting up coils or pipes in the floor, supplying heat from below and moving up. It provides an even, total heat temperature level throughout the space.

<p>A lot of central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioner works but the house does not cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
