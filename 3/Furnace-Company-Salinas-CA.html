<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets ask for assessment and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. The probability of immediate reactions to indoor air contaminants depends upon several aspects including age and preexisting medical conditions.

Some individuals can become sensitized to chemical or biological toxins after repeated or high level direct exposures.<p>

<p>Wetness management and humidity control needs running HVAC systems as designed. Moisture management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to attempt to enhance the operation to save energy. For example, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide makeup air at lower temperatures (design levels), rather of the higher temperatures often used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions.

Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors creates the requirement for cautious attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities trigger mold growth and wetness inside is connected with a greater prevalence of resident respiratory issues.<p>
<p>Outside contaminants. Outdoor particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a house. Particulates and irritants discovered in outside air can be asthma triggers. Filtering inbound air for HVAC systems effectively filters particulates. Experts suggest using filters with a MERV 6-8, but greater MERV levels trap smaller particles and usually are better for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other allergens.<p>
