Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them till they have been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up. If goods with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent sees, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
