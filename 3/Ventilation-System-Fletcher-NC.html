<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Companies in Fletcher</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Right now, countless dust mites, dead skin cells, construction particles, and mold might be living in your home's air ducts, impacting the air you breathe as well as the efficiency of your heating and a/c system. Indoor air quality isn't on most people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a hazard to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a recent survey by the Customer Reports National Proving Ground. But much of the things people do-- or do not do-- can contribute to the stew of airborne impurities in their homes and worsen asthma, allergies, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are becoming common features of environment-friendly homes as part of the growing green structure movement. Green projects accounted for 20 percent of all newly constructed homes in the U.S. in 2015. By 2016, a Wall Street Journal short article predicted that green real estate will grow from $36 billion a year to as much as $114 billion. That's approaching 30 to 40 percent of the entire real estate market.<p>

<p>Old lead-based paint is the most substantial source of lead direct exposure in the U.S. today. Hazardous exposures to lead can be developed when lead-based paint is improperly removed from surfaces by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of airborne lead particles in houses can also result from lead dust from outdoor sources, consisting of contaminated soil tracked within, and use of lead in specific indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
<p>It is not advised that "regular" occupational direct exposure limits (e.g., OELs, TLVs ®, PELs) be utilized to determine if the general indoor air quality fulfills a specific standard. Occupational exposure limitations noted in health and wellness guidelines and the Threshold Limit Values ® (TLVs) advised by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) are intended as a guide to avoid health problem or particular results (like eye and nose irritation) in commercial scenarios. These limitations may not be suitable in office settings or for the home.<p>
