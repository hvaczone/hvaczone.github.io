<p>Numerous commercial structures utilize mechanical ventilation-- fans and ductwork-- that are part of the heating and HVAC systems. Some structures can also use natural ventilation by opening windows or doors. The ventilation rate" is the amount of outside air presented into an area per a system of time, and is frequently revealed in cubic feet per minute (cfm). You can discover the ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers) minimum ventilation rates for acceptable air quality online.<p>
<p>Ask about training and certifications. A great place to begin is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) accreditation. It's sort of a minimum requirement for picking an HVAC company, however a great deal of contractors out there haven't bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by searching for Building Performance Institute (BPI) certification. Supervisors with BPI certification know that the house is a system and see HVAC equipment as simply one element (out of numerous) of a comfortable environment.<p>
<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO protect the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, numerous research studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor wisely, a lot of the 'trustworthy' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales methods that DO benefit from uninformed homeowners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a respectable company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a similar score are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid identify the efficiency of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture, Air cleaning takes place. The goal is to provide enough changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to achieve this. A common element required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
