<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wooden floor joist system, below the wooded subsurface and final flooring finish. This is normally used in a third-floor or second area and takes advantage of the floor joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and additional thickness of an in-screed concrete put. To make an under-timber glowing floor heat hydronic system efficient, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipes to direct heat upward.<p>
