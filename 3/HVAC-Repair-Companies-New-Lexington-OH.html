<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
