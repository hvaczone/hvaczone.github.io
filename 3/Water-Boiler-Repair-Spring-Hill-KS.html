<p>Central air is a high-end not everybody can afford, so many Seattleites should find ways to combat the heat without a duct system.

Meanwhile, in huge box stores like Best Buy, the box fans and window AC systems are snatched up as quickly as they're stacked in floor displays. Seattle may be the last city in the nation to deal with the reality of a cruel, terrible summertime.<p>
