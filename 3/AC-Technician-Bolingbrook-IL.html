<p>If no pollutant sources are discovered, it is still possible that an indoor air contamination issue exists. Extreme re-circulation of air results in "stale air" conditions. Stale air has higher levels of co2 and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air. When ventilation is not sufficient to account for an increase in the number of employees in the area, stagnant air might also be a problem.<p>
<p>Some health effects may appear soon after a single direct exposure or duplicated exposures to a contaminant. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such instant results are normally short-term and treatable. Often the treatment is simply removing the person's direct exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be determined. Not long after exposure to some indoor air pollutants, symptoms of some diseases such as asthma might show up, be aggravated or aggravated.<p>
