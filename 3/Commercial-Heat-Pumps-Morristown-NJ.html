<p>And it's not just downtown high- and mid-rise apartment or condos bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has actually viewed the single-family home installation organisation completely flip on its head the last couple of years. Winter used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to approximately 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and the people." And not simply with beginners more familiar with AC living. Long time Seattle homeowners are finally giving up, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
