Sources of formaldehyde in the home include structure materials, smoking, home items, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning devices, like gas stoves or kerosene area heaters.

<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the ac system works however the house doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
