All five other companies quoted me with different rates and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who discussed to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental house. He helped me problem shoot the concern when I called and he advised me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again.
