<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash can be found in each month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to offer vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There must not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>

Setting up new ductwork for the whole house will cost an average of between $8,900 and $12,300.<p>
