<p>SysTech Style focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and keeping the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your home. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils makes sure dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
