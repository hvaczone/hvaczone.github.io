<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outdoors - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summertime. These convection heaters are still extensively utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>

Often times, these units contain not just the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged units are great for those wanting to conserve cash on the installation of a new heating & cooling system independently, considering that the system is integrated.

Therefore, this might not be the very best option for house owners looking for short-term cost savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
