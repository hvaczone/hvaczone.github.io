We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the whole day as they required to get rid of the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating unit. We decided on getting something more costly than a standard water heater as gas is among our biggest utility costs. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>
