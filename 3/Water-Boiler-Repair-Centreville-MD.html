<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and preserve. Leaking return ducts can also present wetness. Once again, if you presume a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>

Your AC installer will understand what to search for.<p>
