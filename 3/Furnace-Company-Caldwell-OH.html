<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs silently and efficiently, however to have 2 significant components fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the billing prior to work began. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Energy effectiveness can be improved even more in central heating systems by presenting zoned heating. This allows a more granular application of heat, comparable to non-central heating unit. Zones are managed by multiple thermostats. In water heating systems the thermostats control zone valves, and in forced air systems they manage zone dampers inside the vents which selectively block the flow of air. In this case, the control system is extremely critical to maintaining an appropriate temperature.<p>
