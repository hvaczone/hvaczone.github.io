<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, but furnace service technicians frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Look for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

Many steam and radiator boiler systems set up more than 50 years ago remain operable, due to the fact that the absence of moving parts makes them less prone to tear and wear.
