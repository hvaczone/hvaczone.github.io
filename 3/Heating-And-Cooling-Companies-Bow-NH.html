<h3>The Benefits of Routine HVAC Maintenance at Bow NH</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the whole day as they required to eliminate the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heater. We decided on getting something more costly than a conventional water heater as gas is among our greatest utility costs.

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
