<h3>Turning to the Right Company for the Right Furnace Repair at Fairborn OH</h3>
<p>One of the main reasons a furnace will run continuously is because something is filthy or stopped up Before attempting to fix any problem, take time to ensure that the thermostat settings are not at continuous fan". If the air filter is good to go, check the furnace blower for clogging and clean it. If this does not work, take a look at the furnace blower motor and lubricate it. Contact an experienced technician if you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
