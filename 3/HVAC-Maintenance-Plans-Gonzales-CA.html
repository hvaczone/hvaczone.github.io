<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Companies in Gonzales</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Your heating, air, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a variety of impurities that have the potential to negatively affect your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungi, bacteria, and extremely small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor should assess and, if needed, update the building envelope. For example, he may seal gaps and fractures in the external walls and attic flooring, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling costs. Insulation might be a more efficient option to your cooling issues than changing your equipment.<p>
<p>The first ac system and fridges employed toxic or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that could result in fatal mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most utilized in direct-expansion house and building comfort cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
