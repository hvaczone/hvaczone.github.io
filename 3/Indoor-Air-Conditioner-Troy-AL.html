<p>A service prepare for an HVAC company can't remain stagnant if that company is to prosper. You can't just develop your service plan and then forget about it.

That's why regularly examining and upgrading your company strategy is so important.<p>
<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things first. Ensure all the signs up in your home are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Image 2). The decreased airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's great airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've resolved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
