<p>Spot Ventilation. Outside exhaust fans need to be set up in all restrooms and kitchen areas. These fans get rid of humidity and carbon monoxide. The most efficient fans are peaceful and resilient. Use fans that operate at one sone or less and exhaust to the outdoors. Fans geared up with timers or de-humidistat controls work to ensure the fans run for an enough time period. An excellent guideline is to run a restroom fan for about 45 minutes after a shower.<p>
