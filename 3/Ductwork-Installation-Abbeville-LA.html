<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was quick and really clear about his evaluation, guaranteeing I understood what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
