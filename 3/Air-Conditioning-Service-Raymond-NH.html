<h3>HVAC Furnace Air Filters - Things You Must Know Before Buying in Raymond NH</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to eliminate the old water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heating system. We chose getting something more expensive than a traditional hot water heater as gas is one of our biggest utility expenses. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>

At the conclusion of the service check, your HVAC technician goes over any issues or issues and makes suggestions about upgrades where appropriate.<p>
