<p>Current Review: They were excellent! Many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to supply you with the service originally asked for. They met my requirements entirely by offering an expert quote with choices, without pushing additional items. The crew showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and completed a little early. The also promptly followed up with the necessary inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly suggest this company.<p>
<p>As a number of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all significant equipment producer's to guarantee your factory service warranties remain in place. In addition, the tangible outcomes of a PM is often difficult to quantify, as one action stated the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented. A lot of pieces of a furnace or air conditioner do not just break at the breeze of a finger, however rather is the outcome of recurring usage of a part that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger may stop working prematurely since the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering early wear and tear, leading to cracks and holes. If that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and secures the component.  a really advantageous result and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that potentially saved a customer thousands.<p>
