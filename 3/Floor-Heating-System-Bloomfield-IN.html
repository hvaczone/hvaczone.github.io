<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. Once I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the price fantastic but Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my home to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
