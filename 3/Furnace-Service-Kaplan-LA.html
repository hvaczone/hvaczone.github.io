<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you need to check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
