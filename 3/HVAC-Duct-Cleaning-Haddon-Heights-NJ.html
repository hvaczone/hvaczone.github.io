<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply eight to 10 years old, it could grovel twice the electrical power that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's due to the fact that it runs at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to provide a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but nowadays, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling costs than devices installed simply a few years earlier.<p>
<p>Many central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c works however your home does not cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
