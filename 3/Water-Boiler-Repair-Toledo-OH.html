<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts years, because it is secured indoors. When it does need to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical guidelines remove the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground gradually, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>
<p>There is no simple answer, however many utilize the rule of thumb that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, changing is most likely a much better solution. If the current system has not incurred other significant repairs, remains in otherwise outstanding condition, and issues that resulted in the breakdown can be recognized and treated, repairing the system can make a lot of sense also.<p>
