<h3>HVAC Systems Are Essential for All Homes and Offices in Queen Creek AZ</h3>
<p>Elements that can contribute to the growth of biological impurities are wet or wet building materials (carpets, ceilings, walls) and poorly kept humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and a/c. "Humidifier fever" is a typical illness triggered by improper maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and relentless coughs. Different fungi and germs grow rapidly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these pollutants can be dispersed into the air and breathed in by the structure residents. Other possible sources of biological impurities are family pets and family plants.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is usually a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
