<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with questions.

Protexs deal was one of the couple of affordable ones got. Others were nearly twice the quantity Protex priced estimate for low end off brand devices. I got Provider.

<p>Oil heaters tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a lot of soot, which needs to be correctly vented and cleaned from the furnace regularly. Change the filters occasionally and have your ductwork cleaned up due to the fact that the soot develops inside the ducts, decreasing their efficiency over time. Expect to service your furnace annual at a cost of around $200, alter your filters every 1 - 3 months, and clean your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running efficiently.<p>
