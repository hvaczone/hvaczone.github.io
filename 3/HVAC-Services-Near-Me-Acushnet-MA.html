<p>Indoor pollutants. These include chemicals used in the building or restoration of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Incomplete combustion and poor ventilation of these devices (cook stoves, gas furnaces, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can contribute to indoor impurities. Gas cook tops should be utilized with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating home appliances should be sealed and power-vented systems installed to remove items of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning ranges can also produce particulates and should be vented outside.<p>
