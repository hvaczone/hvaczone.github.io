<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to provide your home that best temperature level throughout the year. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing some of those common air pollutants. Eventually, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can result in expensive repairs down the road. So, make sure to alter your AC filters routinely, or get a cooling service plan which typically includes a filter change - especially if you are allergy-prone or reside in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness. The objective is to provide enough changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical component required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
