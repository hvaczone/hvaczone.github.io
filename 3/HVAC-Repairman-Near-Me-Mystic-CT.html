<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork in Mystic CT</h3>
<p>I confess I haven't done the math lately, but I have actually had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine inspections. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right now, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their work with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the unit sits. I feel like they provide me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a bit more for that comfort.<p>
