<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the price great however Mark went out of his way to tailor a few things in my house to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

The typical summertime temperature level to reach the SEER ranking is 83 degrees, so to arrive at the appropriate SEER rating for your location, deduct 2 points for every 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER score needs to be at least 13 for all brand-new cooling units produced in the United States.<p>
