<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you should watch out for. First, you must inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
