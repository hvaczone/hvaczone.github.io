<p>A packaged unit, normally set up on the roofing system, is most commonly utilized on commercial structures, but it is likewise an alternative for homeowners to think about. Often times, these systems consist of not only the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. An advantage of this system is surely the cost. Packaged units are great for those seeking to conserve money on the installation of a new cooling and heating system individually, since the system is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are generally just available for larger homes due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be an excellent way to save cash on a total HVAC system, they're still considerably more expensive than buying simply a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the best alternative for property owners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>
