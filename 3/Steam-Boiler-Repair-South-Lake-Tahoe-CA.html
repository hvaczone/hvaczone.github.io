However, a number of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up many years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
