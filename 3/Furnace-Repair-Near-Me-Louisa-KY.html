<p>UW staff members, visitors and students ought to have a clean, healthy environment in which to work, study and carry out numerous activities. If the air quality is poor it can impact a person's health, convenience, and productivity.

An essential part of the program is reacting to and solving concerns of building occupants about issues in their work environment.<p>
<p>. Prior to picking the installation location of ac system, several main elements need to be thought about. To start with, the direction of air flow from the indoor units should not fall on the location of rest or work area. Secondly, there ought to not be any barriers on the way of the airflow that might prevent it from covering the space of the properties as much as possible. The outside unit must also be found in an open area, otherwise the heat from your house will not be successfully discharged outdoors and the productivity of the whole system will drop sharply. It is extremely recommended to install the ac system units in easily accessible locations, for further maintenance throughout operation.<p>
