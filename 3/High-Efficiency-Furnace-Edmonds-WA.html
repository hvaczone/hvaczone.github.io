The standards do not require you to alter your existing central air conditioning units, and replacement parts and services must still be available for your house's systems. The "lifespan" of a central air conditioner has to do with 15 to twenty years. Makers typically continue to support existing equipment by making replacement parts available and honoring maintenance contracts after the brand-new standard goes into effect.<p>
<p>Underfloor heating is easy to install, specifically if you make it part of a develop or remodelling task. For example, Warmup's StickyMat solution can be set up as a DIY task as it is easy to put down with the electric wire being all pre-spaced and easily attached to the mesh, ready to be presented in place. Plus, there's even an added cleaning convenience as keeping the rooms dust-free is much easier without the nooks and crannies of radiators.<p>
