There can be a major danger from the cumulative effects of these sources.

<p>It may feel relaxing being sealed in tight against the cold in your house during the chillier months of the year, however for individuals who are sensitive to indoor irritants or have respiratory problems, winter season can worsen problems. Stagnant indoor air and heating systems can increase the quantity of allergy-inducing dust mites, pet dander, and mold spores flowing through your home. In late winter and early spring, it might still be too chilly to toss open the windows to pull out the musty air, so while you wait for the warmer weather it's important to be aware of some of the allergic reaction and breathing triggers that may be hiding in your surroundings.<p>
<p>The main reason property owners do not acquire an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 per year, depending on the amount of services offered.
