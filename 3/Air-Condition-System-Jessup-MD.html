<p>RMI is working to alter that, beginning in California. As a first step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set stronger indoor guidelines based on the most current science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to control indoor appliances through codes, and after stronger standards are set there is a chance to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>Inquire about training and accreditations. A good place to begin is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) accreditation. It's kind of a minimum requirement for selecting an HVAC company, however a great deal of contractors out there have not troubled with it! Kick it up a notch by searching for Structure Efficiency Institute (BPI) certification. Managers with BPI accreditation understand that the house is a system and see HVAC equipment as just one element (out of lots of) of a comfortable environment.<p>
<p>If your single phase a/c isn't old adequate to justify replacement, think about a whole home dehumidifier. By installing dehumidification devices inside an existing single stage system, you can enjoy a few of the advantages of a variable speed compressor without changing any devices. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfy level, enhancing indoor air quality and allowing higher convenience at greater temperature levels.<p>
<p>Since my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung around fixing the issue, all the while discussing everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working appropriately. He had to go get the correct replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will certainly use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
