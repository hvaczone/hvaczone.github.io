<p>Exposure Control: Changing the time and location of pollutant exposure. An example of time control is scheduling floor waxing and removing (with the ventilation system operating) on a Friday. This allows items to off-gas over the weekend while the majority of the staff are at house over the weekend. Location control involves moving the contaminant source away from occupants or perhaps transferring prone occupants.<p>
<p>Another alternative to oil heaters are gas heating systems While oil is typically used in areas where gas lines do not run, there are times when you might have a choice between the two types. Gas heating systems cost about the same, around $6,000 for a high-efficiency system. The genuine advantage of utilizing a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your home. Heating with gas costs around $540 a year, rather than the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>

<p>Buildings are developed or intended to react actively to some of these modifications around them with heating, cooling, ventilating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean up, sterilize, and preserve surface areas to improve their look, efficiency, or longevity. In other cases, such changes discreetly or even dramatically alter buildings in ways that may be necessary to their own integrity or their influence on building occupants through the development of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that define them at any time. We may find it useful to combine the tools of the physical sciences with those of the life sciences and, especially, a few of the approaches used by scientists studying ecosystems, in order to get an improved understanding of the environments in which we invest the majority of our time, our structures.<p>
<p>Indoor contaminants. These consist of chemicals used in the building and construction or restoration of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Insufficient combustion and poor ventilation of these appliances (cook stoves, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can contribute to indoor contaminants. Gas cook tops need to be used with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating home appliances must be sealed and power-vented systems installed to get rid of products of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning stoves can also develop particulates and need to be vented outside.<p>
