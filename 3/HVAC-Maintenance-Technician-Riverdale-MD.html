<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold.

To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to temporarily change back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
