<p>Central air conditioning units are determined in loads. This measurement is based on the unit's ability to cool your house. For example, a 1 load system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs.

<p>If the AC does not shut off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not emit heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have welded together-- something that can occur gradually because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay.

This ought to do the trick until you buy a replacement-- which you should do soon.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to temporarily change back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
