<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material over time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
