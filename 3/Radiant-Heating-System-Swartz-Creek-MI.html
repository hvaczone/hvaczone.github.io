The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' cause a problem in the future.

Pressed wood products made for indoor usage consist of: particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in cabinets and furniture); hardwood plywood paneling (used for ornamental wall covering and utilized in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiberboard (utilized for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops).

Nevertheless, there are some internal elements as well. Split systems are perfect for cooling several spaces at the same time, but are not really energy effective.
