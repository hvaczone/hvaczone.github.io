What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss choices. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
