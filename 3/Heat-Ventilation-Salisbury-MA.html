<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The objective is to supply sufficient changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this. A common component necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
