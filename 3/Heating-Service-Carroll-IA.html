<p>A third way to choose whether your home might have bad indoor air quality is to take a look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air pollution. Lastly, try to find indications of problems with the ventilation in your house. Signs that can suggest your house may not have adequate ventilation consist of moisture condensation on windows or walls, stuffy or smelly air, dirty central heating and air cooling devices, and locations where books, shoes, or other products become musty. To identify odors in your house, step outside for a few minutes, and after that upon reentering your home, note whether smells are visible.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture. The objective is to supply adequate modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to achieve this. A common aspect needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
