<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. When I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the rate fantastic however Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
