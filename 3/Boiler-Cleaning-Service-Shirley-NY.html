Such a tool needs to determine the number of people affected; specify ages and task descriptions of involved workers; identify where they are located within the workplace; suggest when the symptoms take place (time of day, day of week, and season); provide a list of particular health signs or diseases; identify all machines operated in the office; suggest the type of outside air contamination; and determine possible sources of job tension.<p>
<p>In 2011, NASA watched for an air conditioning system to set up in their lunar electric rover. They chose they needed professional aid and consulted various providers.
