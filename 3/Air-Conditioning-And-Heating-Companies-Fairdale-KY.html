<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (for the most part) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
