<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were extremely delighted that somebody as knowledgeable as Adam had the ability to fix the air and return conditioner. We had actually purchased the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.)

We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam said he had ways to evaluate AC units even in winter season. We wish we had actually known him then.<p>
