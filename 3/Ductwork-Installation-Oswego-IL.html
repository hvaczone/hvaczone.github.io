<p>If the AC does not switch off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not emit heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have bonded together-- something that can happen over time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold.

To make up for this, the heatpump system must momentarily change back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
