<p>Before installing any brand-new heating or cooling system in a house, it is needed to re evaluate and lower the energy load of the home. A more energy efficient house will not just lower the cost of a new system and energy bills, but it will greatly enhance the convenience of your house. Before we style and set up any systems, we arrange a house energy audit in which an energy auditor will advise improvements and make estimates for cost and energy cost savings from these improvements. Standard improvements normally include adding insulation and air sealing procedures. Energy Environmental Corporation deals with and can suggest numerous certified house Energy Star auditors and installation experts. Please Contact Us for references.<p>
