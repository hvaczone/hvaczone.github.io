<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. First, you ought to check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
