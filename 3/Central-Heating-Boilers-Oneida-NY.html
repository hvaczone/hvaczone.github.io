<h3>The History of Air Source Heat Pumps in Oneida NY</h3>
<p>All modern-day cooling systems, even little window package systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like material, and should be changed or washed as conditions warrant. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will require to have the filters changed more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. Furthermore, very dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
