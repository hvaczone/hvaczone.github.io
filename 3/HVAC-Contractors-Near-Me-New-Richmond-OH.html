<h3>Electric Boiler Repair in New Richmond OH 45157</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
