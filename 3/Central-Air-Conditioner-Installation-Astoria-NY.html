<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
