<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and after that determine the height and width of the opening. When going shopping for an air conditioner to ensure it'll fit easily into the window, be sure to have those measurements on hand.

<p>A packaged unit, normally installed on the roof, is most typically used on commercial buildings, but it is also a choice for house owners to think about. Many times, these units consist of not just the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged systems are great for those seeking to conserve cash on the installation of a new cooling and heating system independently, because the unit is combined. However, one con is that these units are generally just readily available for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity. In addition, while they can be an excellent way to save cash on a total HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than buying just a cooling system. Therefore, this might not be the very best option for house owners looking for short-term cost savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
