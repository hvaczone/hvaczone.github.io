Changed to using Wachoff's about a year back and they've been to your home for a system tune-up three times now. They're priced fairly, have actually dealt with the one repair I required well, and are expert and always on-time.

<p>If you feel like the air produced by your heat pump is burning out cold, you might not have a problem as long as your home still heats up to the best temperature. The temperature of the air produced by the heatpump will not necessarily be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it might not feel really hot. Just be concerned if your home is not warming up. Nevertheless, if your system does not seem working correctly, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you should hire a specialist to repair the unit and check.<p>
