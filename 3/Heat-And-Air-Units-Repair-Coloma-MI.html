<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of solid particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by building, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into structures via natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
