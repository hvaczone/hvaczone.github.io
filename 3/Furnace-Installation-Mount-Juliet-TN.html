<p>Gas furnace repair specialists know that most mechanical failure in heating systems is due to faulty preliminary installation or a repair that wasnâ $ t made correctly. Thatâ $ s why we recommend getting estimates for furnace repair and brand-new furnace installation from a number of HVAC companies.

<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to change your filters regularly, they're not joking. It's as important as a routine oil change in your car. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, tidy filter better traps contaminants and particles in the air. Energy Star recommends replacing your filter once every three months. Throughout high usage months, check the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>
