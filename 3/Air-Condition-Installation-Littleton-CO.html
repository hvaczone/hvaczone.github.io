<p>Central air conditioning is a high-end not everyone can pay for, numerous Seattleites need to find ways to combat the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. Meanwhile, in big box stores like Finest Buy, package fans and window AC units are nabbed up as quickly as they're stacked in floor displays.

Therefore, this might not be the best alternative for homeowners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
