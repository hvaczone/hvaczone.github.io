<p>It prevails to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical product with time.

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
