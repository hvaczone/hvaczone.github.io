<h3>AC Duct Replacement in Havertown Pennsylvania</h3>
<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible growth or a musty odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and check. Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Once again, if you believe a mold issue, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
