<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets requests for assessment and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation procedure. However, a number of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up many years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
