<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me relating to an uncommonly high costs that I got blindsided by BEFORE he knew that I had actually called the service supervisor and left a message of issue.

<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator.

<p>Think about possible effects of indoor air contamination if you use an unvented kerosene or gas area heater.
