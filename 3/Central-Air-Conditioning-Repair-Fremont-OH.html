<p>Biological pollutants include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by animals and individuals; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne. Polluted central air handling systems can end up being breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these pollutants through the house.<p>
