<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not use auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money being available in every month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to provide vehicle debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There must not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
