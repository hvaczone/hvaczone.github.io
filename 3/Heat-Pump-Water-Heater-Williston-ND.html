The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recognized insufficient ventilation as the primary problem in more than half the office indoor air examinations it has performed. Examinations conducted in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have found the same to be true. These investigations revealed that appropriate ventilation is important in keeping excellent indoor air quality.<p>
<p>The likelihood of immediate reactions to indoor air toxins depends on numerous elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 crucial influences.
