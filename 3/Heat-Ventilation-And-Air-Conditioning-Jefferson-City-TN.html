<p>A packaged system, usually installed on the roof, is most typically used on commercial buildings, but it is also a choice for property owners to think about. Many times, these units contain not only the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are terrific for those looking to save cash on the installation of a new heating & cooling system independently, considering that the unit is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are generally only offered for larger homes due to their high power and capacity. Furthermore, while they can be an excellent way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more pricey than purchasing just a cooling system.
