<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
