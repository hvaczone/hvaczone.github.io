<p>They were fantastic! So many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to supply you with the service initially asked for. They met my requirements totally by supplying a professional quote with alternatives, without pressing extra products.

Nevertheless, pick your contractor carefully, many of the 'credible' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales tactics that DO benefit from uninformed homeowners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a reputable company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a similar score are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
