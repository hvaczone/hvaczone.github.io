He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation many years ago and understand the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running.

I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
