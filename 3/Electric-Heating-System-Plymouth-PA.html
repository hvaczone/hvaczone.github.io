<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine co2 must be adjusted frequently, and outdoor measurements utilized for estimations should be made close in time to indoor measurements.
