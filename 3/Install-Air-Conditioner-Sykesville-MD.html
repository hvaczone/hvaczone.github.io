<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pressing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up, do decline them until they have been effectively dried. If products with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent sees, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
