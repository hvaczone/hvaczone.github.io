The bright side is that the one significant disadvantage of heatpump is that they can fail in the cold or extremely hot temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise area.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air since my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose spent time troubleshooting the problem, all the while discussing whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working properly. He had to go get the correct replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will certainly utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
