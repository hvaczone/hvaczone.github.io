Ventilation removes unpleasant smells and excessive wetness, presents outside air, keeps interior building air distributing, and avoids stagnation of the interior air.<p>
<p>When installing a wall sensor, think about the height at which they ought to be put. Many commonly they are installed at height-level or somewhat lower, if people mostly stay seated in that specific location.

For example, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air therefore the greatest concentrations inside buildings are generally near the ceiling. Alternatively, ozone is much heavier than air and stays near the flooring.<p>
