<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. These convection heaters are still commonly used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps can be quickly integrated with existing systems such as traditional forced air or radiant flooring heating or can be set up in a new structure. Required air systems will need a water-to-air heat pump while hydronic radiant heat systems will need water-to-water heat pumps. The size of geothermal heatpump and the size of ground loop required depends on the heating & cooling requirements for your home and is vital iin making sure the performance and efficiency of the system. Capacity for geothermal systems is measured in loads. Typically, a 3-ton setup should be enough for the average home, but house size, heating and cooling needs, local geology and soil, and land schedule are all elements which will influence the right size for your particular house.

<p>Air conditioning and refrigeration are provided through the removal of heat.

<p>A lot of central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning system works but the house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>
