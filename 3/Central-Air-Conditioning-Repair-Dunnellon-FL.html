<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mix of solid particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs.
