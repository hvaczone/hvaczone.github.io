<p>There are some ranges of mold which contain hazardous compounds (mycotoxins). However, exposure to harmful levels of mycotoxin by means of inhalation is not possible in most cases, as contaminants are produced by the fungal body and are not at considerable levels in the launched spores. The main hazard of mold growth, as it connects to indoor air quality, originates from the allergenic properties of the spore cell wall. More serious than many allergenic homes is the ability of mold to trigger episodes face to faces that currently have asthma, a severe respiratory disease.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have very high effectiveness, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer season air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>There's no escaping that all equipment ages with time. However that doesn't suggest that older chillers can not gain from mechanical upgrades. We provide a variety of modernization, retrofit and upgrade options for many equipment types. Variable frequency drives and digital controls upgrade the abilities of older equipment for much better performance without large capital investment. Cooling tower retrofits and other secondary devices in your HVAC portfolio can be improved with instant impact on your bottom line.
