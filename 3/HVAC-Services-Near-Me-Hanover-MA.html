<p>Geothermal heating is among the most efficient heating sources in terms of environmental costs. Since the energy used to heat your house is extracted directly from the ground, it protects the environment from harmful digging, fracking, or contaminants. Geothermal systems use compressor and evaporator systems similar to those used in refrigerators. While geothermal systems do utilize some electrical power, they release far fewer greenhouse gases or other contaminants than heating systems that need gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>
<p>When setting up over concrete slabs, we recommend utilizing our insulation boards. When utilized in combination with underfloor heating by acting as an extremely efficient thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you money. They reflects the heat upwards into the floor tile instead of allowing heat to heat up the concrete slab listed below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after switching on your heating, your floor tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>

<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality problems.

High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
