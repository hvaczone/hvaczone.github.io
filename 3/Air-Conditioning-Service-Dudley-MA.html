<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job finding the outside system as near to the house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
