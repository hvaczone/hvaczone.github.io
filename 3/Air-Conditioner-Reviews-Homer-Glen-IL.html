<p>A customized air conditioning unit that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic air conditioning unit because both the condenser and the evaporator are positioned in the exact same air course. A basic air conditioning system transfers heat energy out of the space because its condenser coil launches heat outside. However, considering that all parts of the dehumidifier remain in the very same room, no heat energy is removed. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the space is really heated up, just as by an electric heater that draws the same amount of power.<p>
