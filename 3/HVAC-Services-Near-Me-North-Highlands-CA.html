<h3>Why Choose a Pure Gas Furnace at North Highlands CA?</h3>
<p>After living in our house for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to replace the cooling. I proceeded and bought this Provider and I must state it does the job rather well. It takes extremely little time to warm up or cool off your home which is among the things we didnâ $ t get from the one we had in the past. The unit hasnâ $ t required any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He knew just what the issue was and fixed it very rapidly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
