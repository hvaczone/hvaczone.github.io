A building walk-through to check for odors and search for water damage, leaks, dirt or bug droppings may be helpful. Leaks require to be eliminated.

The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c works however your house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>
