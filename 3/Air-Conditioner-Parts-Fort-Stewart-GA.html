<p>In most cases, if materials have actually stopped working to dry out a number of days after the suspected water event, mold development is suspected within wall cavities even if it is not immediately visible. Through a mold examination, which might include destructive examination, one should be able to identify the existence or absence of mold. In a situation where there shows up mold and the indoor air quality might have been compromised, mold remediation may be required.

I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
