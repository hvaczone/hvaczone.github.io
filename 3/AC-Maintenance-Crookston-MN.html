<p>Normally the most reliable way to improve indoor air quality is to remove private sources of pollution or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be adapted to reduce the quantity of emissions. In a lot of cases, source control is likewise a more cost-effective approach to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your house are listed later in this area.<p>
<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas area heating system, consider prospective effects of indoor air contamination. Follow the manufacturer's instructions, particularly directions on the correct fuel and keeping the heater correctly changed.

While a space heating system remains in usage, open a door from the space where the heating unit lies to the remainder of the house and open a window somewhat.<p>
