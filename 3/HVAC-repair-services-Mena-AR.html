<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should momentarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
