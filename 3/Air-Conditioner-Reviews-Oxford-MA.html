<p>Current Review: They were great! Many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service initially requested. They met my requirements completely by offering an expert quote with alternatives, without pressing additional items. The crew appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and finished a little early. The also quickly followed up with the essential evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely suggest this company.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's providing the service contract tries to upsell you whenever they concern perform regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be showing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, providing her a 10% discount rate if she restored her PMA for seven years, despite the fact that it was 6 months prior to the current one ended. She didn't need a air purification system, however they talked her into it.<p>
