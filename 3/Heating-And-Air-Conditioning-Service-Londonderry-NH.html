<h3>The Most Frequent Reasons For Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>For whole house installations, it's hard, if nearly impossible, to retrofit a convected heat system in an existing house, especially a hydronic system. Localized radiant flooring heat systems to be used in one or several spaces like restrooms, cooking areas or laundry rooms are quickly renovated with electric glowing flooring heat. This is far more cost-effective on a smaller scale. Larger restorations like additions to a house may be suitable for a bigger scale and more pricey hydronic system.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical mix utilized in vehicles in the U.S. until 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be purchased and utilized by certified HVAC technicians. For systems needing just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and carrying out far much better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "inexpensive" by many individuals.<p>
