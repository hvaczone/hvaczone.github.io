<p>The bottom line is to protect your investment by only utilizing the services of a licensed contractor or a qualified agent from a business or retailer to do the installation.

<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more challenging to control than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity should be kept at or below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to minimize mold growth.<p>
<p>As many of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all significant equipment producer's to guarantee your factory guarantees stay in place. Additionally, the tangible results of a PM is typically difficult to measure, as one response stated the cost savings in efficiency or repairs that were prevented. The majority of pieces of a furnace or a/c unit do not simply break at the breeze of a finger, but instead is the outcome of repetitive usage of a part that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger may fail too soon because the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and triggering premature wear and tear, leading to fractures and holes. If that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and protects the element.  a really useful result and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a client thousands.<p>
