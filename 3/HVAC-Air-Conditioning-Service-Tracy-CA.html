<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's an obscure truth that the quality and tidiness of your air ductwork is just as crucial as your HVAC system. Dust and gunk will frequently build up in ductwork, limiting air flow. Given that ductwork is so complex, duct cleaning and duct maintenance can seem really daunting at first, needing specialized tools, devices, and know-how. When you go with Service HQ's duct cleaning services, you won't have to fret about a thing.<p>
<p>Place the solar storage tank near the standard water heater. Make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the cold and hot water connections are accessible if the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank. It is likely that it is supported by the pipes if the heat exchanger is external to the storage tank. If the tank or heat exchanger ever require to be changed, install unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut.<p>

<p>In a location where temperature levels reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make great main heating unit. You'll want to have a backup system set up, such as a gas furnace, which can take over when temperatures reach freezing. If temperatures reach and drop listed below freezing, your heating technician can install controls which automatically shut down the heat pump. The controls will require the furnace to come on, effectively heating the home in these conditions.<p>
<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to change your filters routinely, they're not kidding. It's as vital as a regular oil modification in your automobile. A dirty filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps pollutants and debris in the air. Once every 3 months, Energy Star recommends replacing your filter. During high use months, check the filters a minimum of monthly.<p>
