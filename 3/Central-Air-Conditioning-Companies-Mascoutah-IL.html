<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must briefly switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
