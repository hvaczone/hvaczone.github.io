<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
