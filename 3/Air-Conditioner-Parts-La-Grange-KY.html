Insulation might be a more efficient service to your cooling problems than changing your devices.<p>
<p>If you operate in building and construction, demolition, painting, with batteries, in a radiator repair shop or lead factory, or your hobby includes lead, you might unconsciously bring lead into your house on your clothing or hands. You might likewise be tracking in lead from soil around your house. Soil very near to homes may be contaminated from lead paint on the exterior of the building. Soil by highways and roadways may be infected from years of exhaust fumes from automobiles and trucks that utilized leaded gas. Use door mats to clean your feet prior to entering the home. Change your clothing before you go home and wash these clothes separately if you work with lead in your task or a pastime. Encourage your children to play in sand and grassy locations instead of dirt which stays with toys and fingers. Try to keep your children from eating dirt, and make certain they wash their hands when they come within.<p>
