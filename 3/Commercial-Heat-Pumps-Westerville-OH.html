<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
