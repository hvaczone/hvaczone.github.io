<h3>Best Central Air Conditioner in Diamond Bar CA 91765</h3>
<p>I normally do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about choices. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>
