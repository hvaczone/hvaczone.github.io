<p>How climate modification impacts air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for modern air conditioning unit) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the ac system boost. This boost has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c must increase its power intake by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioner's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
