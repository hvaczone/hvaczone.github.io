<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. When I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the rate excellent but Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my home to make the total air flow more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
