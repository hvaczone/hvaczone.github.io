<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up, do not accept them until they have been properly dried. Try a various dry cleaner if items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to provide your house that best temperature throughout the year. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining some of those typical air toxins. Ultimately, their air filters fill and stop doing their task. Not just does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can lead to pricey repairs down the road. So, make certain to alter your AC filters regularly, or get an air conditioning service plan which usually includes a filter change - especially if you are allergy-prone or reside in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>
