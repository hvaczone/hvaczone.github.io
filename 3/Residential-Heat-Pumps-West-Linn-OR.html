<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most typical cause of furnace problems.

A dirty filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, decreasing the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

If, for instance, the outside air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you might set up your monitoring equipment to inform you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has reached critical point at 1100 ppm.
