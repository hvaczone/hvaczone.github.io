<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not use automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash coming in on a monthly basis, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to provide auto debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There should not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>
