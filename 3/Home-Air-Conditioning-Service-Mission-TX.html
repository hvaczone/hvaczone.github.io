I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various costs and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who discussed to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. When I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working once again, he helped me difficulty shoot the issue. He is sincere, reputable, and affordable on price. It's difficult to find a truthful AC person and I'm glad I discovered Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
