<p>The properties and composition of the soil in an area can impact the rate at which heat is carried out through the ground.

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pushing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up, do not accept them till they have actually been effectively dried. If products with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent gos to, try a various dry cleaner.<p>
