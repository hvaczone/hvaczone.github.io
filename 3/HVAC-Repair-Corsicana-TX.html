Nevertheless, pick your contractor wisely, a lot of the 'trusted' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales methods that DO take advantage of uninformed property owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program.

The heat can be moved to the surrounding air utilizing radiators, warm water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators may be mounted on walls or installed within the flooring to produce floor heat.<p>
