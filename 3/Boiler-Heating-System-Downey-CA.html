<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done.

I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>We called Elite HEATING AND COOLING on among the hottest days of summer season( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out same day to assess scenario & decided to opt for them for the work. I enjoy to state that not just did we get the central air conditioning going however likewise replaced the heating unit which was old. Everybody we spoke to from starting to end were extremely professional, considerate and the work was very effectively done. I would highly advise this company.<p>
<p>Cooling can likewise be offered by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thus declining its effectiveness.<p>
