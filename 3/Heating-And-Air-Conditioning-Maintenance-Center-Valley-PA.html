<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to provide your home that perfect temperature level all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining a few of those typical air contaminants. Ultimately, their air filters fill and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can lead to costly repairs down the road. So, be sure to change your AC filters routinely, or get an air conditioning service plan which usually consists of a filter modification - specifically if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must briefly change back into the routine a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
