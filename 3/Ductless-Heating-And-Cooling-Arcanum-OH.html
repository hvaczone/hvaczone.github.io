<h3>HVAC Service Technician in Arcanum OH 45304</h3>
<p>Lead has long been acknowledged as a hazardous environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human being Services called lead the " primary environmental hazard to the health of kids in the United States." There are lots of ways in which human beings are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, degrading paint, and dust. When a specific breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled, Airborne lead gets in the body. Before it was understood how hazardous lead could be, it was used in paint, fuel, water pipes, and many other products.<p>

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particle matter is a mixture of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, created by building, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into buildings by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
