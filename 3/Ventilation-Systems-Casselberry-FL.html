<p>We required two check outs - Jake came out first and was extremely knowledgeable and enjoyable and respectful. Grant came out a couple days later and was likewise well-informed and great to speak with. They both did a terrific task.

<p>EER represents Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air systems is measured by the variety of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people don't utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps simply as important when it comes to central air conditioning expenses, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too big will have a simple time keeping the house cool, but will have a more difficult time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not have the ability to effectively cool the home on hot days. Thinking about larger systems cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
