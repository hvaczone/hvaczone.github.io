<p>It is common to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product gradually. In fact, the true nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research study using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
