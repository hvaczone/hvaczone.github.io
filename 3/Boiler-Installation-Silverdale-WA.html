<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you would not provide them.. Secondly like extended automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the needed skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a customer you require to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. Most companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have.
