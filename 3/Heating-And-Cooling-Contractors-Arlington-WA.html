There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
