<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze service through the system's geothermal loop field.

<p>There is a transformer in your cooling furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest will not come on if your transformer breakdowns. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that secure your air conditioning system from flooding. Among the most common areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a good opportunity; you may have a water leakage in the attic if your Nest is revealing a blank screen. The water activates your emergency safety switch, hence cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts down all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have actually seen baseplate spoil on uncommon events.<p>
