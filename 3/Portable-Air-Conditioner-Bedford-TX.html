<h3>Why Fall Is Your Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System at Bedford TX</h3>
<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the procedure of exchanging or changing air in any space to provide high indoor air quality which involves temperature level control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of wetness, smells, smoke, heat, dust, airborne germs, co2, and other gases. Ventilation eliminates undesirable smells and extreme wetness, introduces outside air, keeps interior structure air circulating, and prevents stagnation of the interior air.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
