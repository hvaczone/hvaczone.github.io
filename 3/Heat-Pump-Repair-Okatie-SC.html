<p>Home heating systems are made complex systems that require the services of a contractor to install. While you can definitely purchase your furnace yourself, many contractors will not guarantee the furnace or might not install it if you do not purchase it from them.

<p>A/c can likewise be supplied by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>
