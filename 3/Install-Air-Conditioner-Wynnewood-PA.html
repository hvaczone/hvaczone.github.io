<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you must watch out for. First, you should inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if totally iced over.<p>
