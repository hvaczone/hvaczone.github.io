Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
