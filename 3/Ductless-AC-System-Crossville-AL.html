<p>The pollutants noted in this guide have been shown to trigger the health results mentioned.

<p>3. Gas Furnaces While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is normally greater than numerous heat pump alternatives, they can still be highly efficient, depending on the model you acquire. One of the main advantages of gas heating is that due to the combustion process, it will heat the air to higher temperatures than other heating options. This implies it can warm up your house to the preferred temperature level quicker than a heatpump can.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must briefly change back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
