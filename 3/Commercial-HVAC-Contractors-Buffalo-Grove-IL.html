<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace technicians often discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Look for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Geothermal heatpump can be quickly integrated with existing systems such as traditional forced air or glowing flooring heating or can be installed in a new building. Forced air systems will need a water-to-air heat pump while hydronic radiant heating systems will need water-to-water heat pumps. The size of geothermal heatpump and the size of ground loop needed depends upon the heating and cooling requirements for your home and is vital iin guaranteeing the performance and performance of the system. Capacity for geothermal systems is measured in lots. Usually, a 3-ton setup should be enough for the average home, however home size, heating and cooling requirements, local geology and soil, and land schedule are all elements which will affect the correct size for your particular home. Energy Environmental Corporation is experienced in geothermal heatpump installation and can help you effectively size a system.<p>
