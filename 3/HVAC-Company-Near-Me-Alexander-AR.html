<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heating systems are still commonly used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>

<p>Excellent Product! Shipment was sort of strange being that the box was opened and products might have fell out. However after review of contents we ensured it was all intact.

We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Be sure to watch the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets.
