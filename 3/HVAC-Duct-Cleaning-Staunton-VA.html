<h3>Ductwork Installation in Staunton VA 24401</h3>
<p>The federal government advises that houses be weatherized in order to decrease the quantity of energy required for cooling and heating. While weatherization is underway, however, steps need to also be taken to reduce contamination from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for suggested actions.) In addition, residents need to be alert to the introduction of signs of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, wetness condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew development. Extra weatherization steps ought to not be undertaken till these issues have been fixed.<p>
<p>The earlier you get in touch with Aire Serv, the sooner we can solve your central heat and cooling concerns. In addition to residential and commercial cooling and heating services, our local teams offer other services, including carbon monoxide gas and smoke alarm installation, thermostat installation, and indoor air quality services such as air filtration services and installation of dehumidifiers and humidifiers.<p>
<p>Usually the most reliable way to improve indoor air quality is to eliminate individual sources of contamination or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be adjusted to reduce the amount of emissions. In most cases, source control is likewise a more cost-effective method to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air pollution in your home are noted later in this section.<p>
<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination. For instance, humans exhale co2, which in little quantities is not hazardous, but may become harmful if high concentrations are allowed to collect. Micro-organisms or germs may also be present within the ventilation system. They may spread throughout the whole work environment or building by methods of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do develop.<p>
