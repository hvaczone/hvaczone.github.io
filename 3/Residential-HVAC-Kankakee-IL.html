<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Your air, ventilation, and heating conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a range of impurities that have the potential to adversely affect your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungis, bacteria, and very small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor needs to evaluate and, if necessary, update the building envelope. For example, he may seal gaps and cracks in the outer walls and attic floor, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your cooling and heating costs. Insulation may be a more effective service to your cooling problems than changing your devices.<p>
<p>The life-span of a central air system is thought about to be 15-20 years, and today's a/c are more energy effective than models made even 5 years ago, so it makes monetary sense to replace or update your system if it's five years old or older. The best central air conditioning conditioner you can buy today will use 30-50% less energy than one acquired in 1975 while providing the very same amount of cooling.<p>
