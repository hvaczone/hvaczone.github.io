<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, workplaces and homes matters, especially since we spend the majority of our lives inside your home. Air conditioners help to dehumidify the incoming air, however in very damp climates or in cases where the air conditioner is extra-large, it may not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the air conditioner will require more energy to cool your house. A more suitable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to the majority of existing systems.<p>

Our NATE-certified convenience advisors will without delay diagnose any pending issues with your system and offer energy efficient solutions. We can help you pick the best replacement for your needs if you feel that your air conditioner or furnace is reaching the end of its lifespan.

<p>EPA's Total Exposure Evaluation Method (GROUP) research studies discovered levels of about a dozen common natural pollutants to be 2 to 5 times higher inside houses than outside, regardless of whether the homes were found in highly industrial or rural areas. Extra TEAM research studies show that while people are utilizing products containing organic chemicals, they can expose themselves and others to really high contaminant levels, and raised concentrations can continue the air long after the activity is finished.<p>
