<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash being available in monthly, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to offer auto debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>Asthmatic children are particularly at risk. EPA estimates that exposure to secondhand smoke increases the number of episodes and seriousness of symptoms in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic kids, and might trigger thousands of nonasth-matic children to develop the illness each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition worsened by direct exposure to previously owned smoke each year. Exposure to secondhand smoke causes nose, throat, and eye inflammation. It may affect the cardiovascular system and some research studies have connected exposure to pre-owned smoke with the onset of chest discomfort. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Information Clearinghouse (IAQ DETAILS), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>Air contaminants can vary from impurities brought in from the outdoors by your animals to hazardous gas leakages. Carbon monoxide gas is a common air pollutant resulting from gas that gets away into your home without being burnt. Older houses might contain asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when released into the air. In kitchen areas and restrooms, mold and mildew can become an annoyance where moisture levels are usually higher than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture, Air cleaning occurs. The goal is to provide adequate modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to accomplish this. A common component necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
