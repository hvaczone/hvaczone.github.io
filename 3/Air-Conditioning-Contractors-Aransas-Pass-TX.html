<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is normally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
