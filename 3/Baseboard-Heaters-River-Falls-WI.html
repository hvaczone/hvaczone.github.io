<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>Why Fall Is Your Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System in River Falls WI</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>The condensate drain in your ac system and heat pump need to be devoid of all blockages and debris. Obstructions can block the circulation of condensed water and cause wetness accumulation within the system. Excess moisture can trigger issues like mold, water damage, high levels of humidity in the home, uneven temperature level regulation, germs, and jeopardized air quality. A professional maintenance technician will clean up the condensate and flush drain to make sure all excess wetness streams far from the system.<p>
