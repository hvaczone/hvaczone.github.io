<p>Often, indoor air quality problems in large commercial structures can not be successfully recognized or fixed without a thorough building examination.

<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO maintain the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor carefully, many of the 'reliable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to incorrect sales tactics that DO take advantage of uninformed house owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a trustworthy company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the exact same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
