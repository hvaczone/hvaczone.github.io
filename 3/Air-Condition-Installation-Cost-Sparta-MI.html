<h3>Heat Pumps: What Are They And How Do They Function in Sparta MI?</h3>

The system hasnâ $ t required any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
