<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also switches functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice kinds on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should briefly switch back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
