Breathing air pollutants can lead to allergic and asthmatic responses, infections and other illness that involve the lungs, nose and throat.

<p>The primary issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, employees try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system produces more difficulties, considering that some of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. However, now the marketplace has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units operate separately from each other.<p>

<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the property.<p>
