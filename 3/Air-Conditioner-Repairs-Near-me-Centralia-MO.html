<p>An automobile's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and finally loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant ends up being old and unclean. The old coolant will negatively affect the system's performance. To make sure the system is working effectively, consider having a regular coolant system flush. A coolant flush is standard maintenance for your car's cooling system.

<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it soaks up heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. While doing so, heat is taken in from indoors and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
