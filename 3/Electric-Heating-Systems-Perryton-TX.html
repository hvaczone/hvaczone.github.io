Porous products, floor, wall, and ceiling coverings, and furnishings discovered in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to 48 hours might end up being a source for mold growth and should be discarded. Sometimes there is a moldy smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can grow in covert or seldom accessed areas of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering products consisting of carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be found, opportunities exist will be mold growing nearby. Fix the wetness problem, either by finding the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Completely clean the area utilizing recognized health department suggestions.<p>
