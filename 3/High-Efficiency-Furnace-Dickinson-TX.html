Such a tool needs to identify the number of people impacted; specify ages and task descriptions of involved employees; determine where they are located within the workplace; show when the symptoms happen (time of day, day of week, and season); provide a list of particular health symptoms or illnesses; identify all makers run in the work environment; show the type of outdoors air contamination; and recognize prospective sources of task stress.<p>
<p>They were terrific! So many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to supply you with the service initially asked for. They met my requirements entirely by offering a professional quote with options, without pushing additional products. The team showed up on time, kept me informed as they worked, and ended up a little early. The likewise immediately followed up with the essential evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly recommend this company.<p>
