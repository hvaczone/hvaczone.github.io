<h3>Things to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service at Middlesboro KY</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend used in automobiles in the U.S. until 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be acquired and utilized by licensed HVAC service technicians. For systems requiring only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and performing far better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "low-cost" by numerous people.<p>
