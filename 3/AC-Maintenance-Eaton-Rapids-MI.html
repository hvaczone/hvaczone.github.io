<p>My eldest child constantly grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one.

Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly think about anything else other than replacing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The noise level is low and itâ $ s excellent on energy saving too.<p>
