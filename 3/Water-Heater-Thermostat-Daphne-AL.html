This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical product gradually. In truth, the real nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research study using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
