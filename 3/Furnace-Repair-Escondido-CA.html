(If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI protected.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker journeys.
