Nevertheless, select your contractor wisely, a number of the 'trustworthy' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to incorrect sales techniques that DO benefit from uninformed property owners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line indicator that you MIGHT be working with a reliable company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the very same).
