That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has an opportunity to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary moisture. The outcome is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature indicates. In fact, the space can feel clammy and moist.<p>
