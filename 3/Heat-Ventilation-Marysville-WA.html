<p>Utilizing a range hood with a fan vented to the outdoors considerably minimizes direct exposure to contaminants throughout cooking. Improper modification, often suggested by a consistent yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased pollutant emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame pointer is blue.

<p>When the heatpump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was very helpful in gathering information on the phone and offering clear guidelines about how to temporarily deal with the issue and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and offered clear communication about the problem, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely utilize Stability Energy Systems again, for office and home.<p>
