<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in Milltown NJ</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
