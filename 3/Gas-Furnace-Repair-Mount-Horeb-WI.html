<p>I usually do not leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my options. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over options. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
