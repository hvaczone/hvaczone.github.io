<p>I admit I have not done the mathematics lately, but I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular evaluations. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right now, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their deal with a company that was dealing with the patio where the unit sits. I feel like they provide me preferential treatment, and want to pay a little more for that assurance.<p>
<p>Lots of elements affect IAQ. These elements include poor ventilation (absence of outside air), issues managing temperature, low or high humidity, recent improvement, and other activities in or near a building that can affect the fresh air entering into the structure. Often, particular pollutants like dust from construction or remodelling, mold, cleaning supplies, pesticides, or other airborne chemicals (consisting of small amounts of chemicals launched as a gas with time) may cause poor IAQ.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
