<p>The primary issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, workers attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system develops more problems, considering that a few of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. However, now the market has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units operate separately from each other.<p>
