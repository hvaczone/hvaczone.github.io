<p>Asthmatic children are specifically at danger. EPA estimates that exposure to previously owned smoke increases the number of episodes and seriousness of signs in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic kids, and might trigger thousands of nonasth-matic kids to develop the disease each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition made worse by exposure to pre-owned smoke each year. Exposure to pre-owned smoke triggers eye, throat, and nose inflammation. It might impact the cardiovascular system and some research studies have actually linked direct exposure to secondhand smoke with the beginning of chest discomfort. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Details Clearinghouse (IAQ INFO), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>Lots of AC units feature a number of unique functions that can even more enhance performance and efficiency. For example, property owners might want to look for one that comes with a built-in filter light that will notify you when the air filter needs to be altered.

<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high adequate temperature level, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated without being available in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct, supplying warm air to private bedrooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
