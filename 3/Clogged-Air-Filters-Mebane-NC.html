<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pushing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them till they have been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up. If products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent gos to, attempt a various dry cleaner.<p>

Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom floor.<p>
