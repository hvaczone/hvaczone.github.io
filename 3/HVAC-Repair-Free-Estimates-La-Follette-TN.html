<p>Biological impurities consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transferred by animals and individuals; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can become reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these contaminants through the house.<p>
