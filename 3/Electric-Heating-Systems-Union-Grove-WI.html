<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe between the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the conventional water heater. Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the standard water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes entering and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be shut down completely.<p>
