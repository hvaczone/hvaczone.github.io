<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for a/c repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you should check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
