<p>While pollutants commonly discovered in indoor air are accountable for many harmful results, there is considerable uncertainty about what concentrations or periods of direct exposure are required to produce specific health issue. People also react extremely differently to direct exposure to indoor air toxins. More research study is needed to better comprehend which health results occur after exposure to the typical toxin concentrations found in homes and which take place from the higher concentrations that take place for short amount of times.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the routine a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
