<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
