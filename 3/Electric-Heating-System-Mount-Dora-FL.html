<p>A/c can likewise be offered by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>
