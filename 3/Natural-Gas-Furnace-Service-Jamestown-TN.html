<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
