<p>Asbestos is a mineral fiber that has been utilized frequently in a range of structure construction materials for insulation and as a fire-retardant. EPA and CPSC have actually prohibited numerous asbestos items. Producers have also voluntarily limited uses of asbestos. Today, asbestos is most typically found in older homes, in pipe and furnace insulation products, asbestos shingles, millboard, textured paints and other covering materials, and flooring tiles.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high performances, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
