Part of preserving your furnace involves examining the advised connections along with temperature and pressure determines. Require time to examine these parts for dust and damage, ensuring that they are tight and safe.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task locating the outside unit as near your house as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
