Require time to examine these parts for dust and damage, ensuring that they are tight and safe.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task locating the outside unit as near your house as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
