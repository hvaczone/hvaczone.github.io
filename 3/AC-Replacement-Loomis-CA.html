<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you wouldn't offer them.. Second of all like extended auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the required abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to treat consumers relatively. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to correctly service and the system has been operating issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
