<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation.
