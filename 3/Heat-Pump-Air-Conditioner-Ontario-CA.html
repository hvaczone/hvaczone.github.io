<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your house that best temperature level throughout the year. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining some of those common air pollutants. Ultimately, their air filters fill and stop doing their task.

<p>It prevails to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical material with time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
