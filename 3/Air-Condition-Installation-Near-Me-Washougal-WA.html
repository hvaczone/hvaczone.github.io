Despite the fact that you might believe that emptying the room of all items that may catch fire someday provides sufficient safety, often other scrap such as lint and dust may collect inside the furnace which might trigger a fire. Too much lint and dust will also block your filter sooner than it need to be which will be a blow to your spending plan as you will need to repair or change the equipment.<p>
<p>The cost to repair AC duct runs between $300 to $500 typically.
