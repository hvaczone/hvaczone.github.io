<h3>AC Technician in Bennettsville SC 29512</h3>

<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases emit pollutants.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Advanced designs of new houses are starting to feature mechanical systems that bring outside air into the home. Some of these styles include energy-efficient heat healing ventilators (also known as air-to-air heat exchangers). For additional information about air-to-air heat exchangers, call the Preservation and Renewable Resource Query and Referral Service (CAREIRS), PO Box 3048, Merrifield, VA 22116; (800) 523-2929.<p>
