<p>We contacted Elite A/C on one of the most popular days of summertime( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out same day to assess situation & decided to opt for them for the work. I am happy to say that not just did we get the central air going however also changed the heating system which was old. Everybody we talked to from starting to end were very expert, considerate and the work was extremely efficiently done. I would highly advise this company.<p>
<p>A car's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and lastly loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant ends up being dirty and old. The old coolant will adversely affect the system's efficiency. To ensure the system is working successfully, think about having a regular coolant system flush. A coolant flush is standard maintenance for your cars and truck's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or check out Acme Automobile Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill requirements.<p>
<p>Remember, too, that you may want to speak with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump units can have different heating and cooling capacities.
