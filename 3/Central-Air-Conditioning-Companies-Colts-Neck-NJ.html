<p>A car's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and lastly loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant ends up being dirty and old. The old coolant will adversely affect the system's efficiency. To ensure the system is working successfully, think about having a regular coolant system flush. A coolant flush is standard maintenance for your cars and truck's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or check out Acme Automobile Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill requirements.<p>
