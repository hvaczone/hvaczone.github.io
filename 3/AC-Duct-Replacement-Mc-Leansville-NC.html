<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
