<p>Advanced ventilation systems that enable greater air flow from the outside, air quality tracking platforms and sensing units, and new air filtration innovations are ending up being more common as readily available solutions in commercial and residential HVAC product packages. Adoption of these technologies, however, has not been extensive, as consumers stay mostly unconcerned to the effects of air quality on health and performance.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it takes in heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is soaked up from inside and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Advanced styles of brand-new houses are starting to feature mechanical systems that bring outside air into the home.
