<h3>How To Prevent Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in College Park MD</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you wouldn't use them.. Second of all like extended auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the needed abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a customer you require to be well notified in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to correctly service and the system has actually been operating problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
