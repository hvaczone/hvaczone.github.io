<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives requests for consultation and support in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. The likelihood of immediate responses to indoor air contaminants depends upon numerous elements including age and preexisting medical conditions. Sometimes, whether an individual responds to a toxin depends upon specific level of sensitivity, which differs tremendously from person to individual. Some individuals can become sensitized to biological or chemical contaminants after repeated or high level exposures.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a variety of different heating systems, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems operate on similar principles. In the case of a boiler, the system warms by dispersing warm water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the room.<p>

Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and keep. Dripping return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
