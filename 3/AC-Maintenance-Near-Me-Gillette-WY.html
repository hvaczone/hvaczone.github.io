<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace service technicians often find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

When radon ends up being caught in structures and concentrations develop inside, exposure to radon becomes an issue.<p>
