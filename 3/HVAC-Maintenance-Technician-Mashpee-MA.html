<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must temporarily change back into the regular cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
