<p>An undersize system won't have the ability to cool rooms down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate due to the fact that it has to run longer than a properly sized unit. Since it just takes more electrical energy to run a larger unit, a large-scale compressor likewise costs more to run. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity successfully. That's since it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has a chance to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the essential wetness. The result is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature level shows. In truth, the space can feel damp and clammy.<p>
