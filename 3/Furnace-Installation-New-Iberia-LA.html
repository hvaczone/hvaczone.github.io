<p>Award Winning Pipes and HVAC Services. Many typical building materials used prior to 1975 include asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating unit, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Usually, considerable releases of asbestos fiber do not occur unless the building products are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building renovation. Removal of asbestos-containing materials is not always ideal since the fibers can be spread into the air throughout the removal process. A management program for undamaged asbestos-containing materials is often recommended instead.<p>
<p>The first air conditioners and fridges utilized combustible or hazardous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that could lead to fatal accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion house and structure convenience cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
