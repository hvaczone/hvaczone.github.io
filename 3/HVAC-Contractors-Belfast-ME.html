The likelihood of immediate reactions to indoor air contaminants depends upon numerous factors consisting of age and preexisting medical conditions. In some cases, whether an individual reacts to a contaminant depends on specific level of sensitivity, which varies enormously from person to individual. Some individuals can become sensitized to chemical or biological contaminants after duplicated or high level direct exposures.<p>

<p>The remainder of the HVAC system also needs to be in top condition for the air conditioning unit to work well. This consists of the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and registers, all of which reside inside the house.

Sealing leaks in ductwork can improve HVAC effectiveness by as much as 30 percent, and attend to a cooler home in the hot summer season.<p>

The ideal humidity in a house is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
