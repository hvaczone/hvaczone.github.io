<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold.

Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
