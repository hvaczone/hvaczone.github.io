If you've installed the parts revealed and reinstalled the detach block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature level below the indoor temperature, and the unit doesn't fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
