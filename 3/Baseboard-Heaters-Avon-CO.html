Pressed wood items produced indoor use consist of: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in cabinets and furniture); wood plywood paneling (utilized for decorative wall covering and used in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiber board (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furnishings tops).
