<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and contaminant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system components, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>

<p>It is still possible that an indoor air contamination issue exists if no impurity sources are discovered. Excessive re-circulation of air results in "stagnant air" conditions.

Stagnant air may also be a problem when ventilation is not enough to account for a boost in the variety of workers in the location.<p>
<p>Our indoor air quality experts can transform your heating and cooling system into a whole-house air treatment center. To reduce contaminants, we recommend installing innovative air cleaning systems like MicroPower Guard filters, which are designed to eliminate the smallest particles from the air. The OxyQuantum UV sterilization systems likewise assist manage bacteria and organic smells. The majority of store-bought filters can not get rid of these smallest of allergens and don't eliminate gases and germs.<p>
<p>In more complex plans, warm air is enabled to rise and flow out high structure openings to the outdoors (stack impact ), triggering cool outside air to be drawn into low structure openings. Natural ventilation plans can use really little energy, but care should be required to make sure convenience. In damp or warm climates, keeping thermal convenience exclusively through natural ventilation may not be possible. Air conditioning systems are utilized, either as supplements or backups. Air-side economizers also use outside air to condition spaces, but do so utilizing fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to present and distribute cool outdoor air when appropriate.<p>
