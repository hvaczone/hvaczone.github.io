It actually depends upon what you value the most in a top brand name central air conditioner. The major aspects for most homeowners will be the total cost to set up the best air conditioning unit brand names, life-span of the AC system, warranties offered, energy effectiveness (SEER rankings), and size of the unit you require for your home's square video footage (LOADS) to efficiently cool your house.<p>
