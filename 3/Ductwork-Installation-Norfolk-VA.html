<p>How environment change impacts air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for contemporary a/c unit) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the ac system boost. This increase has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system removes that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c should increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
