<p>Think about a whole house dehumidifier if your single phase air conditioner isn't old sufficient to justify replacement. By setting up dehumidification devices inside an existing single phase system, you can delight in a few of the benefits of a variable speed compressor without changing any equipment.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to briefly change back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
