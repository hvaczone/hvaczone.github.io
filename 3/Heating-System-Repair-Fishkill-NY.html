<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a reasonably easy to measure surrogate for indoor pollutants produced by humans, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are unusually high inside your home might trigger occupants to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are usually 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level thought about acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the main indoor source of carbon dioxide in most buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are a sign of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a pipe two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "hard part" once a year turned off the electrical energy open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the parts, close up the cabinet put back on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
