<p>Current Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
