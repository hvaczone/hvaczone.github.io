<p>A packaged system, generally installed on the roof, is most typically used on commercial structures, however it is also a choice for property owners to think about. Many times, these units consist of not only the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this unit is certainly the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those seeking to save money on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system independently, given that the unit is combined. However, one con is that these systems are generally only readily available for larger homes due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be a great way to save money on a total HVAC system, they're still significantly more pricey than buying simply a cooling system. Therefore, this might not be the very best option for house owners searching for short-term savings or those with smaller sized spending plans.<p>
