<p>AC systems and thermostats have integrated hold-up features when they're closed down and after that repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually signed up for an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts revealed and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature listed below the indoor temperature, and the system does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, know that there are maintenance products that just a trained HVAC technician will be able to do.
