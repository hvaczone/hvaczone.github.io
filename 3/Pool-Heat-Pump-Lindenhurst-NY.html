<h3>Facts All Lindenhurst NY Homeowners Must Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even small window plan systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and must be changed or washed as conditions necessitate.

Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. In addition, really dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
