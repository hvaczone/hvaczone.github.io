A ductless unit has a built-in efficiency benefit due to the fact that up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit might be lost to leakages in your ducts.

Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensors that immediately raise the temperature level in the room when you are present.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
