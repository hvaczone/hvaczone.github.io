<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outside unit as close to the house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

We had actually acquired the club member maintenance strategy, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any property buyers: employ Blue Flame to check the air conditioning system before you purchase. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam stated he had ways to check AC systems even in winter. We wish we had known him then.<p>
