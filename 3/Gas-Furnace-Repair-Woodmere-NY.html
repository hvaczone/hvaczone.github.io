He understood just what the problem was and repaired it very quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
