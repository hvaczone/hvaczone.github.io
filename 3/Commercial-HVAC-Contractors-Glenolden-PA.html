<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
