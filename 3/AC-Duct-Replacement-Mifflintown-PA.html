Even if you make sure" the condenser coils are tidy, tidy them once again. Shut off the power. Flip the cooling service and furnace circuit breakers in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, shut off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then tug the disconnect block (Image 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Picture 2). If the air conditioning service still doesn't work properly after you've cleaned the condenser coils, installed a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of money coming in every month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to offer car debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There must not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
