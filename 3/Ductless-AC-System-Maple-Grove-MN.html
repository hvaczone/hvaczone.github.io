<p>Lots of individuals are ending up being more concerned and aware about their health and the impact of indoor air quality. Dust and dirt containing contaminants and irritants can cover the cooling ductwork with time.

Beacon Pipes, Seattle, WA cleans up the duct physically by getting rid of the debris from the air filter.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
