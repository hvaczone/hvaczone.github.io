Feel free to ask about our service strategies that consist of preventive maintenance if you want to remain ahead of any issues with your house or service HVAC system, so you can prevent pricey repairs or replacements.<p>

<p>Both need to be kept clean since an air conditioner moves heat in between the outside coil and the indoor coil. This implies that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to regularly clean the condenser coil.

<p>It may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't offer off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can take place in time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must work until you purchase a replacement-- which you must do quickly.<p>
