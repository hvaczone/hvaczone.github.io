<h3>AC Duct Replacement in Troutman North Carolina</h3>
<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either because of noticeable development or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not eliminate the mold.

<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
