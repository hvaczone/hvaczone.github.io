<p>I have been using them for several years for my businesses, my own homes and my realty customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different costs and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who discussed to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental house. When I called and he advised me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working again, he helped me difficulty shoot the issue. He is sincere, reliable, and sensible on cost. It's tough to find a truthful AC man and I'm pleased I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
