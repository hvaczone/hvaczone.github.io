<h3>Common Causes of Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Wakefield MA</h3>
<p>Factors that can contribute to the development of biological contaminants are damp or moist building materials (carpeting, ceilings, walls) and inadequately preserved humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioners. "Humidifier fever" is a common health problem brought on by improper maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and persistent coughs. Numerous fungis and germs grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these pollutants can be distributed into the air and inhaled by the building residents. Other possible sources of biological contaminants are family pets and home plants.<p>
<p>The first step to fixing any problem is diagnosing what the issue is in the first place. If we find your system requires a major repair, we waive our diagnostic fees. When we do any repair, the parts we use are supported with a two-year parts warranty. Our diagnostics service and waived fee provide you with a second option that comes with the service warranty perk if you have actually spoken to another company and got a quote.<p>
