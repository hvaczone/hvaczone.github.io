<h3>Gas Furnace Service in Hazlet New Jersey</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the home.<p>

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in.
