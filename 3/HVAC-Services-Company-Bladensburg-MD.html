<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO protect the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, numerous studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor carefully, much of the 'trustworthy' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales methods that DO benefit from uninformed house owners.

A typical element required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
