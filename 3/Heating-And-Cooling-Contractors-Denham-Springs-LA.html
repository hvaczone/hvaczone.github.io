<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summer. These convection heating units are still widely used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>The term radiant heating covers a couple of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are described hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often referred to as merely glowing systems. Electric radiant heat systems have actually heating aspects installed in the subfloor of each space in the home, periodically connected to terminal units like baseboard heating systems. When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your home. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the method is referred to as radiant heat.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
