<p>When they put a 24 hour emergency ac repair request, the majority of Midtown Houston Tx customers don't understand why their HVAC unit is not working. The copper lines at the outdoors unit we'll be frozen too if your evaporator coil is frozen. Depending on how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a good concept of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil. The first thing you need to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is filthy, you're in luck, that's probably your problem. The next step is to thaw your air conditioning equipment if you found that your conditioning filter needs replacing. The simplest way to thaw your HVAC devices is to leave the unit off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
