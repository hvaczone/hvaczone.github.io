<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the exact same. As soon as the circuitry is total, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable warms. Don't put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to properly treat and solidify-- generally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom floor.<p>
<p>This review is for changing a 17 year old AC with a brand-new AC, humidifier, air purification system and thermostat. The technician who explained our choices did an excellent job in making certain we comprehended the pros and cons of each choice. The technicians who set up the new system were expert and fast, while requiring time to ensure we understood how the brand-new system worked. In general a first rate experience.<p>
