<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often gets ask for assessment and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. However, a lot of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed many years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Wetness management and humidity control requires running HVAC systems as created.
