<h3>The Way to Prevent Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Sainte Genevieve MO</h3>
<p>All modern a/c systems, even small window bundle units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be changed or washed as conditions warrant.

Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Furthermore, very filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
