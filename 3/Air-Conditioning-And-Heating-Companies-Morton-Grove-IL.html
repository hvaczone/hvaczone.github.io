The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>

<p>While these actions will assist to keep your AC system in leading shape, know that there are maintenance products that only a qualified HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can cause expensive compressor failure, however a homeowner does not have the tools or skills necessary to examine refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and correct air flow are important to a well-functioning system, however house owners do not have the required equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy homeowner, it's still essential to have a professional technician inspect the system regularly.<p>
<p>Central air is a high-end not everyone can pay for, so many Seattleites need to find methods to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. On the other hand, in big box stores like Best Buy, package fans and window AC systems are snatched up as soon as they're stacked in floor screens. Seattle may be the last city in the nation to deal with the truth of a cruel, harsh summertime.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you ought to examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
