This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall.

Ductless heatpump are excellent for additions due to the fact that they don't require any new ductwork to be installed. Since an unit is installed in each room or area you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that instantly raise the temperature in the room when you are present.<p>
