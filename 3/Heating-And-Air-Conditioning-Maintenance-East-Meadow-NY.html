<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Information For East Meadow NY Home Owners</h3>
<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the job based just on emails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the couple of sensible ones received. Others were almost two times the amount Protex quoted for low end off brand equipment. I got Provider. ProTex properly advised me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The set up team was respectful of my home and installed the devices in the anticipated quantity of time. post install inspection outcomes look excellent for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools much better than the 13 years of age 4 load R22 system it replaced (likewise Carrier).<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend used in autos in the U.S. till 1994, when most styles altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be acquired and used by qualified HVAC service technicians. For systems needing just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and carrying out far better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "low-cost" by numerous individuals.<p>
