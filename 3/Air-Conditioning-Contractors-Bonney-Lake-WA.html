<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
