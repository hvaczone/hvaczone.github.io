<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. When I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the rate fantastic but Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more enhanced.
