CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that permits the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system elements, and impurity sources.

What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my options. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about choices. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
