<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to alter your filters routinely, they're not kidding. It's as crucial as a routine oil change in your automobile. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps pollutants and particles in the air. When every 3 months, Energy Star advises replacing your filter. During high use months, inspect the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>
