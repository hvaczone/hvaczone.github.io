<p>. Prior to picking the installation area of a/c, several main elements require to be considered. First of all, the instructions of air circulation from the indoor units ought to not fall on the place of rest or workspace. Secondly, there must not be any obstacles en route of the airflow that might avoid it from covering the space of the facilities as much as possible.
