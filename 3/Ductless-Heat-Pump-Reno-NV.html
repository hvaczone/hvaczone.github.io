<p>If you seem like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you might not have an issue as long as your house still heats up to the best temperature level. The temperature level of the air produced by the heat pump will not necessarily be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it might not feel really hot. If your home is not heating up, only be concerned. Nevertheless, if your system does not seem working appropriately, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be a circumstances where you ought to call in a specialist to examine and repair the unit.<p>
