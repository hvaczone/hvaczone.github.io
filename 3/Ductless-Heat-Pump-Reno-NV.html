<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- provide All Vovo a call! Heat pumps work effectively in temperate climates like King and South Snohomish counties. Running on electrical energy, a heatpump is a cost-effective solution using a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your fridge, but in reverse. Rather of warming or cooling the air currently inside your house, it draws heat or cool from the air exterior and pushes it through the ventilation system of your house.<p>
<p>If you seem like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you might not have an issue as long as your house still heats up to the best temperature level. The temperature level of the air produced by the heat pump will not necessarily be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it might not feel really hot. If your home is not heating up, only be concerned. Nevertheless, if your system does not seem working appropriately, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be a circumstances where you ought to call in a specialist to examine and repair the unit.<p>
