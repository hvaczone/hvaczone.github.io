<p>How environment change impacts air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for modern-day air conditioning unit) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning system increase. This boost has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit must increase its power usage by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners are more efficient than space a/c. In addition, they are out of the method, peaceful, and convenient to run.

In an average air-conditioned house, a/c takes in more than 2,000 kilowatt-hours of electrical energy each year, triggering power plants to emit about 3,500 pounds of co2 and 31 pounds of sulfur dioxide.<p>
