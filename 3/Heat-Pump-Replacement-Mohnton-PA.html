Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
