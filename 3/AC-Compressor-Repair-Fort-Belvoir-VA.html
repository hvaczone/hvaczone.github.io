<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the typical house. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the inbound air is decreased, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same. A few of the sensible heat of the getting in air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite considerable if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
