<p>Find Out About PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends upon how well it collects toxins from indoor air (revealed as a portion performance rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (revealed in cubic feet per minute). A very efficient collector with a low air-circulation rate will not be effective, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less effective collector. The long-term performance of any air cleaner depends on keeping it according to the maker's directions.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned regularly, they can become clogged with debris that can restrict airflow, potentially impacting your comfort and your system's performance. Filthy filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace elements and in more severe cases cause the system to close down entirely. By contrast, checking and replacing a furnace filter can usually be done in just a few minutes, typically without any tools needed. As a precaution, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
