<p>A homeowner can successfully learn to do a project such as bleeding and restarting an oil furnace, however you need to be positive that you understand what you're doing. People who are experienced with such do-it-yourself jobs will most likely have the ability to bleed the furnace without too much of a concern. People who rarely do this type of work around your house need to let an expert handle it You can always find out if you wish to, but going at it alone the first time isn't an excellent idea if you don't know what's going on.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more difficult to manage than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity must be preserved at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to reduce mold growth.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The objective is to supply sufficient modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical aspect needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
