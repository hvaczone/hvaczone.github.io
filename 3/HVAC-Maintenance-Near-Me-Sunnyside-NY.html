<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of different heater, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on comparable principles. In the case of a boiler, the system warms by distributing hot water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
