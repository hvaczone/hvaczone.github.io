<p>People working in buildings with poor IAQ may discover unpleasant or moldy smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems.

And almost 20 percent still smoke at home or let others smoke there. All of those things can get worse indoor air quality.<p>
