<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't use them.  Secondly like prolonged auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the needed abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to treat customers relatively. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely benefited from. Many companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to properly service and the system has been running issue complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
