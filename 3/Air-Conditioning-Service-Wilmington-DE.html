<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the typical home. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, often described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the inbound air is minimized, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the sensible heat of the entering air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be rather considerable.<p>
