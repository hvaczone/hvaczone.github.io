<p>Re-install the gain access to panel and disconnect block. Switch on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait on the AC to begin (see Be Patient at Startup," below). The compressor should run and the condenser fan need to spin. The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor starts but the fan does not. Turn off the power and eliminate the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and remove the fan blade and motor (Image 7). Reinstall the blade and secure the cover. Then repower the system and see if the fan starts. If  it doesn't, you've given it your finest shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
