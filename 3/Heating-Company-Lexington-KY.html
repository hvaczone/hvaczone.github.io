<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act just like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system.

Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the need to install an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical material with time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
