<p>Reality: Geothermal systems in fact take in no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that very same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that squandered the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are extremely rare now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really eliminate millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been vaporized in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
<p>When installing the whole system, geothermal heat pump cost is far more than other heat pump types. Geothermal systems require underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy. Installing one included excavation, running hundreds of yards of piping, burying the loop, and more. This process is quite expensive. Setting up a new geothermal heatpump to deal with an existing ground loop is far more affordable.<p>
