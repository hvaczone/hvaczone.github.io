<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They give me priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Purchased a brand-new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended guarantees or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to offer me something I do not need.<p>
