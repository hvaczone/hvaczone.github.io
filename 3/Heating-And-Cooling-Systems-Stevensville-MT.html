<p>I generally don't leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my options. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss choices. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family pal and now I will advise this company to my pals.<p>
