<h3>Gas Central Heating Systems in Hallsville TX - The Benefits</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The present trend in house building and construction is to reduce air leak through cracks and other openings in roofing systems, walls, and floorings. The mix of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much greater. This fresh cosmetics air dilutes indoor pollutants and helps tire them from the home.<p>
