<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the typical home. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the incoming air is decreased, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the practical heat of the getting in air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather considerable if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts airflows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems.

CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in large residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
