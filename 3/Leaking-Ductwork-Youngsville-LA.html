<h3>Electric Heat Pump in Youngsville Louisiana</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the visit. They suggested replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't cheap but a fast web search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I gladly had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the check out or the brand-new part. I was really delighted they waited their work and repaired the problem. Will absolutely be utilizing them again.<p>
