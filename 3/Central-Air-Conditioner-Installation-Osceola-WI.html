<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with questions. He devoted to the job based only on emails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the few affordable ones received. Others were almost twice the quantity Protex estimated for low end off brand name equipment. I got Provider. ProTex appropriately recommended me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The install group was respectful of my home and installed the equipment in the expected amount of time. post install examination outcomes look very good for braising and pipes quality. New system cools much better than the 13 year old 4 ton R22 unit it changed (also Provider).<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
