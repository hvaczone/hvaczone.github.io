<h3>Things to Know Before Becoming a HVAC Contractor at Rotonda West FL</h3>
<p>Factors that can contribute to the development of biological pollutants are wet or moist building materials (carpeting, ceilings, walls) and improperly preserved humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioners. "Humidifier fever" is a typical health problem caused by inappropriate maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs. Different fungi and germs grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. Throughout operation, these contaminants can be dispersed into the air and breathed in by the building residents. Other possible sources of biological contaminants are family pets and household plants.<p>
