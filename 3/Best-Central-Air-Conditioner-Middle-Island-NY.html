<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you should examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system.

If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
