Pushed wood items made for indoor usage consist of: particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in cabinetry and furniture); hardwood plywood paneling (used for ornamental wall covering and used in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiberboard (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops).
