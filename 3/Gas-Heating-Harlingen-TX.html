<p>Poor indoor air quality is typically brought on by the absence of appropriate ventilation, which results in an accumulation of pollutants from sources in the house. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health determined inadequate ventilation as the main problem in majority the office indoor air examinations it has carried out.

The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs.
