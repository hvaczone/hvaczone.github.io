<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
