<p>Specialist heating system setups. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heating system will ultimately fail. HVAC specialists suggest following this fundamental rule when choosing whether it's worth investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the rate of a brand-new system, it's finest to purchase brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system will not have many more years left in it, and it's most likely to be utilizing more energy than essential.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of common air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years approximately. Unscrew the old AC contactor prior to getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new unit (Photo 6).<p>
