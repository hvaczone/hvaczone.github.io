<p>Ducted heatpump heating and cooling systems act just like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. If your home or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most affordable. Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to set up an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>A/c can likewise be supplied by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>
