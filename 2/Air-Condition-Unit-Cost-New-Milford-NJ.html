<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs quietly and effectively, but to have 2 significant parts stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the invoice before work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>People have actually been poisoned by scraping or sanding lead paint due to the fact that these activities produce big quantities of lead dust. Consult your state health or real estate department for tips on which private labs or public companies may be able to help check your home for lead in paint. House test kits can not find percentages of lead under some conditions. Hire a person with unique training for remedying lead paint problems to eliminate lead-based paint. Occupants, especially children and pregnant females, need to leave the building up until all work is completed and clean-up is done.<p>

<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix used in cars in the U.S. until 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this type of application, however is still imported and can be acquired and used by certified HVAC specialists. For systems needing only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and performing far much better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "inexpensive" by lots of individuals.<p>

<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices typically lasts decades, given that it is protected indoors. When it does need to be replaced, the expense is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most pricey to set up. New technical guidelines get rid of the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot gradually, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>
<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Many heating systems have multiple control boards. The biggest, or only one in some furnaces, is often called the Motherboard.
