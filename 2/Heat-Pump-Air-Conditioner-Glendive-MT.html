<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a moldy odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and inspect. Leaking return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>Some diseases, like humidifier fever, are connected with exposure to toxic substances from microbes that can grow in large building ventilation systems.
