<p>Radiant heat covers a range of various heating systems, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems run on comparable principles.

As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
