<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise because 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one constraint: their total power must not exceed the capability of the outside unit. In practice, however, it is really typical to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units greater than the outside capacity by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to anticipate better performance when all indoor units are turned on at the very same time, given that the overall capacity of the entire system is restricted by the capability of the outside system. Put simply, the outside unit will distribute all its power to all running indoor systems in such a way that some of the rooms may not have an extremely comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the total power is not simple, given that it considers not only the small power of the units, but also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outdoor system as near to your home as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
