<p>, if the hvac company didn't come out ahead they wouldn't provide agreements.. The so called reliable companies swindle more people than the fly by night outfits. I know due to the fact that I tried to work for them. I give up since 90% of them are scoundrels. They walk in with or without a contract and start selling you things you don't require. They lie. How do I understand. I now work as an expert to validate the so called issues and remedies. 9 out of 10, I check are entirely incorrect.<p>
