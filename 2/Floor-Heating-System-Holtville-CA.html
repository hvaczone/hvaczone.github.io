<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

<p>As a number of you discussed, preventative maintenance is required by all significant equipment maker's to ensure your factory service warranties remain in place. In addition, the tangible results of a PM is frequently hard to measure, as one reaction stated the cost savings in performance or repairs that were prevented.

For instance, a heat exchanger may fail prematurely since the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and causing premature degeneration, leading to fractures and holes. If that customer had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the part.  a very useful outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a customer thousands.<p>
