<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to change your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as vital as a routine oil modification in your vehicle.

During high usage months, check the filters at least monthly.<p>

We had actually purchased the club member maintenance plan, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to evaluate the a/c unit prior to you buy. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam stated he had methods to evaluate AC systems even in winter. We want we had understood him then.<p>
