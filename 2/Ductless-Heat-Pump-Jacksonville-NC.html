<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your house that ideal temperature all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining a few of those typical air toxins. Ultimately, their air filters fill and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can cause pricey repairs down the roadway. So, make certain to change your AC filters routinely, or get a cooling service plan which typically consists of a filter modification - especially if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an essential role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of procedures which results in the supply and removal of air from inside a building." Those procedures include bringing in outside air, conditioning it and blending it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the building, and moving some portion of indoor air outside. The quality of indoor air will be affected if one or more of these procedures are underperforming.<p>
