<p>Moisture management and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as developed.

For example, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide make-up air at lower temperatures (design levels), rather of the higher temperature levels often utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, for the majority of the US and many parts of Europe and Japan, throughout most of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need further cooling to offer thermal comfort inside your home. However, high humidity outdoors develops the need for careful attention to humidity levels inside.
