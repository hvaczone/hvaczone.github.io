<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air problems by including brand-new toxins to the air.

Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination.

They may spread throughout the whole work environment or structure by methods of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do establish.<p>
