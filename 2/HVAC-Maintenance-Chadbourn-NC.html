<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile tube) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Ask about training and accreditations. A great location to begin is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) accreditation. It's kind of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, however a lot of contractors out there haven't troubled with it! Kick it up a notch by searching for Building Efficiency Institute (BPI) accreditation. Supervisors with BPI certification know that the house is a system and see HVAC devices as just one component (out of many) of a comfortable environment.<p>
