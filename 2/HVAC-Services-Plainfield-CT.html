<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up routinely, they can become clogged with debris that can limit air flow, possibly affecting your convenience and your system's performance. Filthy filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace components and in more severe cases trigger the system to shut down totally. By comparison, inspecting and replacing a furnace filter can generally be carried out in simply a few minutes, often without any tools required. As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, generally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
