<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations.

<p>It prevails to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as relatively the same physical material in time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions.
