<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>This is particularly significant, as gas ranges can trigger levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors.

This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
