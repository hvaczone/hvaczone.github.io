Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has actually seen the single-family home installation company entirely turn on its head the last couple of years. Winter used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times swelling to as much as three months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and individuals." And not just with newbies more accustomed to AC living. Long time Seattle house owners are lastly giving in, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the consistent heat distribution over the whole surface of a flooring warms the lower half of the room, enveloping inhabitants in warmth at a lower general temperature level-- in some cases up to 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a conventional heating system." Simply put, in-floor heater provide a different mode and level of convenience. And, as various public awareness projects have long advised us, the more comfy we feel, the more inclined we may be to nudge down our thermostat, in turn lowering our energy expenses.<p>
