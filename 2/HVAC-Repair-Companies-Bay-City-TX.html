<p>Sean was very helpful. He is a really pleasant person to work with. No pressure applied to buy extra stuff. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no issues besides the blower motor. The only factor he might not set up the new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
