<p>EER means Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a conventional system of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people don't use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Unstable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals released as gases from processes or products; for the a lot of part, you can smell their existence. Common sources of VOCs indoors consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively innocuous as a new carpet is most likely to be emitting formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside might include unstable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water usage.<p>
<p>After the system has been looked for leaks, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that includes fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside must be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>
