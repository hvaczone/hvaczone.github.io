<p>Current Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
