<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you should examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
