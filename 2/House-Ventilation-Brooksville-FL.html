<p>Dometic's commercial grade rooftop ac system are performance-tested to conquer uncommon or extreme road and weather. Many basic units break down after just 4 hours of extreme vibration screening, while the Vigorous II is still going strong at 30 hours and more! The galvanized steel top plate provides lasting strength while long copper lines minimize vibration and, for that reason, sound too. While being among the most difficult a/c around, its 410A refrigerant is kinder to the environment. Robust, capable and light-weight of performing in any environment! It will not let you down.<p>
<p>I am replacing our High Velocity System since of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted devices, a Carrier, Comfort Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also installing an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding three (3) high velocity supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will likewise reuse the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will also install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I likewise have a choice for an additional $2,818.00 to install a Provider Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>If your single phase air conditioning unit isn't old adequate to validate replacement, consider a whole house dehumidifier. By installing dehumidification devices inside an existing single stage system, you can enjoy some of the advantages of a variable speed compressor without changing any equipment. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfy level, enhancing indoor air quality and enabling greater convenience at greater temperature levels.<p>
<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have problems, they give me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy prolonged warranties or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
