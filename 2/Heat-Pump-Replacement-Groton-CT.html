<p>While toxins frequently discovered in indoor air are accountable for lots of harmful effects, there is substantial unpredictability about what concentrations or periods of direct exposure are necessary to produce specific health problems.

<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material gradually. In reality, the real nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
