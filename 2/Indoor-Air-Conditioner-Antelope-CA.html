<p>Location the solar storage tank near the traditional hot water heater.

<h3>HVAC Repair in Antelope California</h3>
<p>Good contractors utilize load-calculating software that consider such information as the number of windows in your home, the density of insulation, the setup of the attic, and the building's orientation to the sun. It produces not only a precise tonnage requirement, but figures out just how much cool air each space needs. All quotes (get at least three, from licensed, well-regarded companies) must include this one-page printout.<p>
<p>In an area where temperature levels reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make great main heating systems. You'll want to have a backup system installed, such as a gas furnace, which can take over when temperatures reach freezing. If temperature levels drop and reach listed below freezing, your heating technician can set up controls which automatically shut down the heat pump. The controls will call for the furnace to come on, effectively heating the house in these conditions.<p>
<p>Ac system can produce a great deal of water since they get rid of wetness from the air. To eliminate this, they have a generally plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Over time, algae can block this pipe and, when it does, the AC will not work. In reality, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the area. To deal with condensate issues, please see A/c unit Leaks Water, below.<p>
