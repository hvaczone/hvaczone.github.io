For instance, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide cosmetics air at lower temperatures (design levels), instead of the higher temperature levels sometimes utilized to conserve energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. However, for most of the United States and many parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require further cooling to supply thermal comfort inside. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors creates the need for careful attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities generate mold growth and moisture inside is related to a greater frequency of occupant breathing issues.<p>
<p>A lot of HVAC systems now have programmable thermostats that allow property owners to manage the temperature level and set it on a schedule. For example, you can set the thermostat to decrease the heat when you're not in house to conserve cash on the energy costs and make sure the system isn't overloaded. A professional technician will inspect the thermostat throughout the yearly maintenance to ensure the actual temperature and the temperature level on the thermostat matches. The technician needs to examine the thermostat's efficiency or assess the whole HVAC system if there's a distinction in the temperature.<p>
