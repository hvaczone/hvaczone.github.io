<p>Think about possible effects of indoor air pollution if you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heating unit. Follow the maker's instructions, especially directions on the correct fuel and keeping the heating unit appropriately adjusted. A relentless yellow-tipped flame is generally an indication of maladjustment and increased toxin emissions. While a space heater remains in usage, open a door from the room where the heating unit is located to the remainder of the house and open a window a little.<p>
