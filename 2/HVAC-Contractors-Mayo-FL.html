<p>Have actually utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have concerns, they provide me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I do not need.<p>
