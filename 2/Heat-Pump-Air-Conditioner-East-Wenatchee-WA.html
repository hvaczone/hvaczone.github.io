While both were informative and practical, Ballard Natural Gas offered us a much better offer, for remarkable service. Instead of a simple sales task, the owner of the company made a complete evaluation of our heating unit and located methods we might have more even heat.

<p>Most central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning unit works but your home doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
