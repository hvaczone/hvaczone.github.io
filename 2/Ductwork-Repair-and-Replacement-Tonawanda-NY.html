This doesn't seem like much, particularly if the objective of owning a company was for financial liberty. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it took to construct business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% usually isn't the end goal. HVAC business owners need to pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their revenues while keeping costs the same in all other locations.<p>
