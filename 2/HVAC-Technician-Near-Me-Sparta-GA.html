<p>A packaged unit, typically installed on the roof, is most typically utilized on commercial structures, however it is also a choice for property owners to think about. Many times, these systems include not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged units are fantastic for those aiming to conserve money on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system independently, considering that the system is integrated. However, one con is that these units are usually only available for larger homes due to their high power and capacity. Furthermore, while they can be a great way to save money on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more pricey than purchasing simply a cooling system. Therefore, this might not be the very best alternative for house owners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
