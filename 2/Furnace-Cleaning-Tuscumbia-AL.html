<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and impurity concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that permits the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system parts, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in large residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>

<p>Packaged terminal ac system (PTAC) systems are likewise called wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often utilized in hotels, have two different units (terminal plans), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening going through the wall and linking them. This reduces the interior system footprint and permits each room to be changed independently. PTAC systems might be adjusted to offer heating in cold weather, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, converting the a/c unit into a heatpump While room cooling supplies optimum flexibility, when used to cool many spaces at a time it is typically more pricey than central air.<p>
