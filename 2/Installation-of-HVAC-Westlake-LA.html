<h3>The Function of the Boiler Burner at Westlake LA</h3>
<p>I confess I have not done the mathematics lately, however I have actually had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to routine evaluations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their deal with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the system sits. I seem like they provide me preferential treatment, and want to pay a bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
