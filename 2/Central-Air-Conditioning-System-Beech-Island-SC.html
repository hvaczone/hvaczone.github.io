Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the traditional water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the water pipe getting in and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summertime when water temperatures are high, and the standard hot water heater can be turned off totally.<p>

<h3>The History of Air Source Heat Pumps at Beech Island SC</h3>
<p>I admit I haven't done the mathematics recently, however I have actually had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to routine examinations. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded immediately, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their work with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the system sits. I feel like they give me favoritism, and want to pay a little more for that assurance.<p>
