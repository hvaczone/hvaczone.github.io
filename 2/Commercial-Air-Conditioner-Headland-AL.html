<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & knowledgeable throughout the visit. They advised changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't cheap but a fast web search validated WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I gladly had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the go to or the new part. I was extremely delighted they stood by their work and fixed the problem. Will certainly be utilizing them once again.<p>

Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
