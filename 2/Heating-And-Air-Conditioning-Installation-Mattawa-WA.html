<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms warmed by radiators are susceptible to cold spots", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and extremely hot next to the radiators.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must momentarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
