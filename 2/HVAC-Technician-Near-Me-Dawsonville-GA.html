The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 ought to be adjusted frequently, and outdoor measurements used for estimations should be made close in time to indoor measurements.
