<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as a Necessary Business in Los Angeles. Today's furnaces are ranked 90% performance or better; it is not unusual for a modern furnace to be rated 94 or 95% effective. Compared to older designs, which might be ranked as low as 80% effectiveness, this can indicate significant savings in yearly heating costs. Modern two- and three-stage heating systems increase performance even further by performing at lower or greater capacity depending on the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>Whether you have central air, a ductless system, or a heatpump, whatever needs to be changed ultimately. As devices ages, it becomes less efficient. Central air conditioning systems and heatpump usually last about 10-15 years. Ductless split systems can last up to 20 years.
