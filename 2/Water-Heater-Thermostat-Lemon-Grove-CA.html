<p>You might update to the highest performance gear offered and still not feel conveniently cool on hot days. That's because the mechanicals are only part of the central air system. The average house's ductwork leaks 10% to 30% of its air before it can reach your home, according to Pacific Gas & Electric.

<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
