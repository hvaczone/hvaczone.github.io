<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer season air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
