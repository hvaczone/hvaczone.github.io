<p>Initially, in regards to advantages, heating the entire home or building from one unit makes things easier logistically, and the isolation of the heating unit from the home is a perk for some house owners. The system can be utilized to supply hot water as well as environment control.

You can also set a schedule with central heating systems. Overall, central heating offers a lowered environmental effect.<p>

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c works however the house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
