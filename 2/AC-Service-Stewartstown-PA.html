<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

As a primary step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set stronger indoor standards based upon the most recent science for NO2.

<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Many heaters have multiple control panel. The biggest, or only one in some heating systems, is often called the Motherboard. The circuit boards manage and collaborate the operation of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more.
