Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage.

<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product in time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
