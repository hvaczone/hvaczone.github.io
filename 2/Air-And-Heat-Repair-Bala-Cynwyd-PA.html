<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly receives requests for consultation and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms.

Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
