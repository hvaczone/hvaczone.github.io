<p>Check these three things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the registers in the house are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the lowered airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
