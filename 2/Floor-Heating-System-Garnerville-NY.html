Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no problems other than the blower motor.

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you should examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
