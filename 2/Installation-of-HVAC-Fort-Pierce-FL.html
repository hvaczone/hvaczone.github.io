<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
