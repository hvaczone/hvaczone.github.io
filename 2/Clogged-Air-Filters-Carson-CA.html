Stale indoor air and heating systems can increase the quantity of allergy-inducing allergen, animal dander, and mold spores distributing through your home. In late winter season and early spring, it might still be too cold to throw open the windows to pull out the moldy air, so while you await the warmer weather it is necessary to be knowledgeable about a few of the allergy and respiratory triggers that may be prowling in your environments.<p>
