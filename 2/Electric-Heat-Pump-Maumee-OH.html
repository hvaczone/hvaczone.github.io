Luis was the 6th individual, who explained to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. He helped me problem shoot the issue when I called and he advised me to get in touch with guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working once again. He is honest, reliable, and sensible on price. It's tough to discover an honest AC guy and I'm thankful I discovered Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
