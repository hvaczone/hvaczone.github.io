<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outside system as close to the house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to view the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center..

<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the ac system works however your home does not cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>
