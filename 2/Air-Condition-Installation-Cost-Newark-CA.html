<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Oil heating systems are typically not really efficient. They use less fuel than other furnace types, but most do not achieve a performance greater than 90%. A couple of high-end brands have an efficiency of 95% by utilizing a condenser. These are more expensive, having beginning expenses for the furnace itself at around $5,000. You pay more for the installation also because a drain needs to be set up.<p>
