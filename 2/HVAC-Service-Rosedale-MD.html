<p>If the hvac company didn't come out ahead they wouldn't offer agreements.  The so called reliable companies dupe more people than the fly by night outfits. Because I tried to work for them, I understand. Because 90% of them are criminals, I stop. They walk in with or without a contract and start selling you things you don't require. They lie. How do I know. I now work as an expert to verify the so called issues and remedies. 9 out of 10, I inspect are completely incorrect.<p>
