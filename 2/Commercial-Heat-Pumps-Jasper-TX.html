<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the rate fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my home to make the total air flow more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<h3>Repair and Maintenance for Jasper TX Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, sending the absorbed heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression procedure. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>
