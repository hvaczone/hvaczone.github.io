<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it soaks up heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is absorbed from inside and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Humid and damp conditions reproduce mold and mildew that can trigger breathing issues like allergies and asthma. Depending upon your place, the hot summertime can produce specifically humid conditions. Minimize the amount of moisture in the air and curb the growth of annoying molds with a couple of well-placed dehumidifiers. There are a variety of humidifier alternatives that will help preserve consistent humidity levels and produce comfortable living conditions in your home.<p>
