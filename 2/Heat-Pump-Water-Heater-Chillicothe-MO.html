<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold.

Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
