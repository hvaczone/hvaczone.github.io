<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
