This means that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to frequently clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately lead to harm to the compressor, since the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
