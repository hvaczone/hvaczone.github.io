<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality in Cassville MO</h3>
<p>Factors that can add to the development of biological pollutants are moist or damp building products (carpeting, ceilings, walls) and improperly preserved humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and a/c unit. "Humidifier fever" is a typical disease triggered by improper maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and persistent coughs. Numerous fungis and bacteria grow rapidly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. Throughout operation, these contaminants can be distributed into the air and inhaled by the structure occupants. Other possible sources of biological pollutants are pets and household plants.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
