<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, meaning they use air to exchange heat, in the exact same way as an automobile radiator or normal household a/c does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It gathers water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which should be vented outside the cooled location; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled location to the outdoors air.<p>
