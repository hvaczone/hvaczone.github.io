<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pressing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them till they have been effectively dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you select them up. Attempt a various dry cleaner if products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
