<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Advice For Virginia Beach VA Home Owners</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>When all the jobs have actually been finished, the last task is to check the system to make certain it cools efficiently. HVAC systems are run through the thermostat. This final check may explain faults in the thermostat, which may be as simple as a requirement to replace batteries. A failure to turn on may just involve a tripped breaker. At the conclusion of the service check, your HVAC technician discusses any issues or concerns and makes recommendations about upgrades where appropriate.<p>
