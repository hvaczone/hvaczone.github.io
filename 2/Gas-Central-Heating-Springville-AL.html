<p>Have actually utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have problems, they give me priority and a lower rate. Bought a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I do not require.<p>
