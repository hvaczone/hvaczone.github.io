<h3>A Synopsis of Central Heating Systems in Trafford PA</h3>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps are extremely effective, due to the fact that ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature is always at a constant temperature. These systems can obtain a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heatpump can only achieve a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Much like other types of heatpump, ground source heatpump have their geothermal efficiency ranked according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE). POLICE rates just how much heat a system produces or gets rid of (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to develop the heating or cooling effect. A lot of ground source heat pumps have Police officers of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this means is that for every single unit of energy used by a geothermal heatpump, approximately 3 to 5 units are provided back in the form of heat.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
