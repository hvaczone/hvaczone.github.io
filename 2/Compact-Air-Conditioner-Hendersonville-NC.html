It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular assessments. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their deal with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the unit sits. I feel like they offer me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a little bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
