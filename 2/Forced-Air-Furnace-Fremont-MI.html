<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of money can be found in on a monthly basis, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to use vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement..
