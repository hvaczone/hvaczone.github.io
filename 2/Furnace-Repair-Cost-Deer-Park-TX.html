In North America, divided systems are frequently seen in residential applications, but they are acquiring popularity in small commercial structures. The split systems are a great choice for small structures where ductwork is not possible or where the space conditioning performance is of prime issue. 19 The advantages of ductless cooling systems consist of easy installation, no ductwork, higher zonal control, versatility of control and peaceful operation. citation required In area conditioning, the duct losses can account for 30% of energy intake. 20 Making use of minisplit can result in energy cost savings in space conditioning as there are no losses connected with ducting.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps can be easily integrated with existing systems such as traditional forced air or radiant flooring heating or can be set up in a new structure.

The size of geothermal heat pump and the size of ground loop required depends on the cooling and heating requirements for your house and is crucial iin guaranteeing the effectiveness and performance of the system. Capability for geothermal systems is measured in loads.

Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the ac system works but your home doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
