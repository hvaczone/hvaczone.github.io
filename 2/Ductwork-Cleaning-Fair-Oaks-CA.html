<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to eliminate the old water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating unit. We chose getting something more expensive than a conventional water heater as gas is among our biggest utility expenses. We feel that this brand-new system will last a long time and usage really little energy to heat water.<p>

If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
