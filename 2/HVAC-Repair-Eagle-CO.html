<h3>Things to Know Before Becoming a HVAC Contractor at Eagle CO</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to get rid of the old water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heating system. We decided on getting something more expensive than a standard hot water heater as gas is among our biggest energy expenditures. We feel that this new unit will last a very long time and usage really little energy to heat water.<p>
