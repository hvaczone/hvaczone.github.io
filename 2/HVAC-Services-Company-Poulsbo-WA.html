<p>All Points Heating offers home air conditioning, a/c unit installation, a/c maintenance that deliver reputable, proven performance at high efficiency. Combustion items from car exhaust, heating systems, hot water heater, space heating systems, scented candles, oil lamps, wood stoves, fireplaces, and gas stoves that are not effectively vented can produce carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and respirable particulates.

<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the home.<p>
