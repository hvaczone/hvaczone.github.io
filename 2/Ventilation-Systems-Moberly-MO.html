<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. Even with regular preventive maintenance, however, there will always be the odd issue that occasionally comes up. When you do observe your furnace acting oddly, it is extremely important that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as soon as possible. The faster you respond to problems with your furnace, the simpler they are to repair. Waiting to require repairs will only make the issue worse, and typically more expensive.<p>
<p>I'll begin with a gas furnace because it's the most common heating unit in Seattle homes. Warm air is provided to the spaces of your home via ducts, and cool air is gathered via cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are ranked for effectiveness. Older systems from the 1970s might be rated 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is squandered during the combustion process. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%. If your home currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a fairly uncomplicated process. Setting up a new gas furnace system can be quite costly if you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>
