<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in many cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI protected.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
