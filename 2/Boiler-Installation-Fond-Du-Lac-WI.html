<p>Correct ventilation assists improve indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality exterior is worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are often 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and sometimes these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the exact same toxins.

If you work with lead in your task or a hobby, alter your clothes before you go home and wash these clothing individually. Motivate your kids to play in sand and grassy locations instead of dirt which stays with toys and fingers. Try to keep your children from eating dirt, and ensure they wash their hands when they come within.<p>

Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00.
