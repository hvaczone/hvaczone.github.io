<p>WE ARE ALSO USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the conventional water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the conventional water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the pipes leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the conventional water heater can be shut down entirely.<p>
<p>Whether you have central air conditioning, a ductless system, or a heatpump, whatever requires to be changed eventually. As equipment ages, it ends up being less effective.
