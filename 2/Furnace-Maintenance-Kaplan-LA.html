<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air issues by adding brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often give off pollutants.) Nevertheless, measures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the quantity of outside air penetrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Sometimes a short-lived indoor air quality problem is created simply by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity taking place inside a room or building, such as an overcrowded conference area. In those cases, a short-term fix might be all that's required, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. However more intricate issues-- determined by consistently inappropriate air quality tracking results-- will need a various tack. Depending upon the concern you're experiencing, among the 3 tactics listed below might be appropriate.<p>
