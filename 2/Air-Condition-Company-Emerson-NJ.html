<h3>Central Heating Repair in Emerson New Jersey</h3>
<p>If you think a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a moldy smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and inspect. Dripping return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you presume a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
