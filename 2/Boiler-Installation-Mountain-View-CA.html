Most pieces of a furnace or air conditioning system do not just break at the breeze of a finger, however rather is the outcome of repetitive usage of a part that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger may stop working prematurely because the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and triggering early degeneration, leading to holes and fractures. , if that customer had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and protects the part.. an extremely helpful outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a customer thousands.<p>
