<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol effect, most frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from inadequately positioned or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which often launch water in an aerosol which may go into neighboring ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical facilities and retirement home, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually involved outside water fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy people require heavy exposure to acquire infection.<p>
