<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
