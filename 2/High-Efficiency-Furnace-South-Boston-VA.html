<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in many cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem circuit breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine carbon dioxide must be calibrated often, and outside measurements used for computations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors might also be needed.<p>
