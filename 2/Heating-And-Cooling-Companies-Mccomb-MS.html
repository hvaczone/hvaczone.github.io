<p>All heating systems have some level of air filtration. From one of the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter frequently in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all require some standard maintenance. These filters assist with indoor air quality by trapping air-borne pollutants streaming through your system. They can also keep your system performing well by helping reduce the buildup of dust, dirt and other particles from accumulating on internal components like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then determine the height and width of the opening. When shopping for an air conditioner to ensure it'll fit comfortably into the window, be sure to have those measurements on hand. Also, keep fire security in mind when deciding where to set up the a/c: Don't place it in an egress window that works as the only methods of escape should a fire appear.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to offer your house that best temperature throughout the year. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing a few of those typical air contaminants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their task. Not only does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can cause pricey repairs down the road. So, make certain to alter your AC filters regularly, or get an a/c service plan which normally consists of a filter change - especially if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>
