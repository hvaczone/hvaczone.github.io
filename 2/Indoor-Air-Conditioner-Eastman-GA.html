<p>The results of lead direct exposure on fetuses and kids can be serious. They include hold-ups in mental and physical development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention periods, and increased behavioral issues.

Children might have greater direct exposures since they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>
