<p>The results of lead direct exposure on fetuses and kids can be serious. They include hold-ups in mental and physical development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention periods, and increased behavioral issues. Children, babies, and fetuses are more vulnerable to lead exposure than grownups given that lead is more quickly soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more sensitive to the damaging effects of lead. Children might have greater direct exposures since they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>
