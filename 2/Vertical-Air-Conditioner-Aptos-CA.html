<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the average house. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the incoming air is lowered, but it is likewise more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the sensible heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite substantial if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
