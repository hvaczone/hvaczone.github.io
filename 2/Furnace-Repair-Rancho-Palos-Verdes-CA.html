<p>EER means Energy Performance Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a conventional system of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people do not utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Bear in mind, too, that you may want to talk with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump units can have various heating and cooling capabilities. You might look for a heat pump more tailored towards cooling capability and effectiveness if you already have a home heating system. For a higher-end model to look after your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally wish to look for a design that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. Fortunately is that the one major drawback of heatpump is that they can fail in the cold or very hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high adequate temperature level, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct work, supplying warm air to private bed rooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
