<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible tube) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts decades, given that it is secured inside.

New technical standards get rid of the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground in time, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>
