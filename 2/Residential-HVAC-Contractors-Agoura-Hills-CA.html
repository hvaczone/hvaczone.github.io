<p>EER stands for Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy performance of central air systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a conventional system of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people do not use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps just as important when it pertains to central air conditioning expenses, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too large will have a simple time keeping the house cool, however will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air.
