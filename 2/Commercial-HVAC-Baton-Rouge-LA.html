<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indication of ventilation adequacy.
