<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, understand that there are maintenance products that just a skilled HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a sluggish refrigerant leak in your AC system can cause costly compressor failure, however a homeowner doesn't have the tools or skills required to check refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and proper airflow are important to a well-functioning system, but property owners do not have the needed equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart homeowner, it's still necessary to have a professional technician inspect the system regularly.<p>
<p>If the AC does not switch off, it may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not produce heat effectively and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can take place in time due to the fact that of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts.
