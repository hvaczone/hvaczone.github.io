<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Most heating systems have several control boards. The biggest, or just one in some heaters, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards control and collaborate the operation of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, however the new control panel should be installed precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the issue isnâ $ t appropriately diagnosed, altering a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable as soon as set up.
