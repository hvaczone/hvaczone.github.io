<p>I typically don't leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to replace your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
