<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not offer auto debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of money can be found in every month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to provide automobile debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There must not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>
