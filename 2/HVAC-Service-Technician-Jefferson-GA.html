<h3>The Way to Keep Healthy Ductwork for A Healthy Home in Jefferson GA</h3>
<p>Your lungs are accountable for bringing fresh air into your body, while concurrently getting rid of waste gases and particulates.

Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
