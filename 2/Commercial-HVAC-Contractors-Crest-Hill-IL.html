<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Current studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pushing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do decline them up until they have been effectively dried. If items with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent check outs, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
