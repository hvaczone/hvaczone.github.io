Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no concerns other than the blower motor. The only factor he could not install the new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
