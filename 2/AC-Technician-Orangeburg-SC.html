<h3>Window Air Conditioner in Orangeburg South Carolina</h3>

<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a photo of the wires before detaching anything (you might need a referral later on). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've swapped all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
