<h3>Why Choose a Pure Gas Furnace in Loris SC?</h3>
<p>A hydronic radiant floor heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a labyrinth of pipes set up under the flooring or right within the floor surface area itself. The heat from the warm water transfers to the flooring mass and then radiates through thermal transfer to other posts with solid mass such as the walls, ceilings, furnishings and individuals. It does not count on heating or moving air to transfer heat.<p>
<p>Oil furnaces tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a lot of soot, which needs to be appropriately vented and cleaned up from the furnace regularly. Change the filters occasionally and have your ductwork cleaned because the soot builds up inside the ducts, lowering their effectiveness in time. Expect to service your furnace yearly at a cost of around $200, alter your filters every 1 - 3 months, and clean your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running efficiently.<p>
