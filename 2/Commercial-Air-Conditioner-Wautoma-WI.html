<p>Companies are needed to follow the General Duty Clause of the OSHAct, which needs them to offer employees with a safe workplace that does not have any known dangers that trigger or are most likely to cause death or serious injury. The OSHAct also requires companies to obey occupational security and health standards produced under it. Employers must be fairly knowledgeable about the possible sources of poor air quality, and they need to have the resources necessary to acknowledge and control workplace risks. It is also their duty to inform staff members of the immediate risks that are present.Specific state and local guidelines may apply.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you would not use them.. Secondly like extended automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required abilities to do the job and also the morals to treat clients fairly. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be completely benefited from. Many companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to correctly service and the unit has actually been running issue free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
