<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most common reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too quickly, and your home won't heat up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, replace the filter. An unclean filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, decreasing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the eye, throat, and nose and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is likewise evidence from animal research studies that duplicated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. People at specific danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and people with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
<p>Integrity Energy was quick to react when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 heaters were not working. They showed up the next day and replaced 2 furnaces and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday up until the new furnaces can heat the house. Truthfully, our home heating system is made complex, Rob and his group fixed the old duct work, changed all the dampers, make the entire system work completely.<p>

Demand heats up throughout the summer and winter season when clients need their HVAC systems repaired for relief against the heat and cold; service calls drop off when milder weather condition gets here.<p>
