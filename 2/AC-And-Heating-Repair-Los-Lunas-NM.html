<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly receives requests for assessment and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation step. However, much of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>Instead of incorporating to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall. A ductless unit has an integrated effectiveness advantage because up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leakages in your ducts. Ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions due to the fact that they don't need any new ductwork to be set up. Since an unit is set up in each space or area you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that instantly raise the temperature in the room when you are present.<p>
