<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help figure out the effectiveness of dilution.

When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness, Air cleaning occurs. The goal is to provide sufficient changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to accomplish this.
