<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
