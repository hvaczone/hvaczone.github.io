<p>Inquire about training and certifications. A great place to start is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) accreditation. It's sort of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, but a lot of contractors out there have not bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by searching for Building Performance Institute (BPI) certification. Supervisors with BPI certification know that the house is a system and see HVAC devices as simply one aspect (out of lots of) of a comfortable environment.<p>
<p>The instructions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the same. When the wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable warms. Don't put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively harden and treat-- typically two to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
