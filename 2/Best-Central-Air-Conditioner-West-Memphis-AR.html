<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He understood just what the problem was and fixed it really rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
