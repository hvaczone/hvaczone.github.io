<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Ask about training and certifications. A great place to start is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) accreditation.

Supervisors with BPI accreditation understand that the house is a system and see HVAC equipment as simply one aspect (out of many) of a comfy environment.<p>
<p>When they place a 24 hour emergency ac repair request, most Midtown Houston Tx customers don't know why their HVAC system is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors unit we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a good concept of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to examine your conditioning filters. If your filter is filthy, you remain in luck, that's more than likely your issue. The next step is to defrost your air conditioning equipment if you discovered that your conditioning filter needs replacing. The most convenient method to defrost your HVAC devices is to leave the unit off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
<p>The steadiness of the industry's growth doesn't always equate to the experience of operating an HVAC company. The ventilation, heating and air conditioning service tends to run cold and hot. Demand heats up throughout the summertime and winter season when consumers require their HVAC systems fixed for relief against the heat and cold; service calls drop off when milder weather condition gets here.<p>
