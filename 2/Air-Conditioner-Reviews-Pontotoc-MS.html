<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
