However, select your contractor carefully, a lot of the 'trusted' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales techniques that DO make the most of uninformed house owners.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold.

Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
