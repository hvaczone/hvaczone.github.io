<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts decades, given that it is protected inside your home. When it does need to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical guidelines remove the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot over time, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>

<p>Second, identification of contaminant sources is frequently important to identifying the cause( s) of employee health symptoms. Such info can in some cases be obtained by asking for copies of air tracking information from the employer. If monitoring information is not available, yet a high number of health signs have actually been reported, the Union representative should request that the employer have air monitoring tests conducted. Evaluation of this information might recognize possibly dangerous sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. Nevertheless, when contaminant concentrations are really low, keeping track of data may not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
