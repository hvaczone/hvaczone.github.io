<h3>Heating Strategies For Gas Home Furnaces at Orange CT</h3>
<p>Your lungs are accountable for bringing fresh air into your body, while all at once removing waste gases and particulates.

Poor air quality - whether it is indoors or outdoors - can make it progressively hard for your lungs to work correctly, and can have negative health affects.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is usually a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter.

If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
