<h3>Heating Strategies For Gas Home Furnaces at Orange CT</h3>
<p>Your lungs are accountable for bringing fresh air into your body, while all at once removing waste gases and particulates. Needless to say, the more particles that are in the air you breathe, the more difficult it is for your lungs to remove them. Poor air quality - whether it is indoors or outdoors - can make it progressively hard for your lungs to work correctly, and can have negative health affects.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is usually a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
