<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air.

For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide need to be adjusted regularly, and outdoor measurements utilized for calculations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors might likewise be essential.<p>
