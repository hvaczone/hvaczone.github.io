<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for ac system repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you ought to inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system.

When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
