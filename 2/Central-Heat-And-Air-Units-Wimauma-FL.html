After checking 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, measured particle levels really increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
