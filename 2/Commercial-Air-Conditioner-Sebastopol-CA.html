<p>How environment change affects air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a basic mode of operation for contemporary air conditioning unit) needs that the rate of energy removal by the ac system increase. This increase has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system need to increase its power intake by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the ac system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioner's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
