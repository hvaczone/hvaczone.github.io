HVAC professionals recommend following this basic rule when choosing whether it deserves buying a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost majority the rate of a brand-new system, it's best to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have much more years left in it, and it's most likely to be utilizing more energy than necessary.<p>

By comparison, examining and changing a furnace filter can typically be performed in simply a few minutes, typically without any tools needed. As a precaution, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, usually installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
