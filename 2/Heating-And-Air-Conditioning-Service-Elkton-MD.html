<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you need to look out for. First, you need to examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
