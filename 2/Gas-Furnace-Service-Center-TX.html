<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. In time, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Prior to that happens, you want to get those capacitors changed to avoid more damage to your system.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness. The objective is to supply adequate modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this. A common element required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
