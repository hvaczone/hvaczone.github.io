<h3>Elements of a High Efficiency Furnace in Falfurrias TX</h3>
<p>I admit I have not done the math recently, but I have actually had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular evaluations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their work with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the unit sits. I seem like they give me favoritism, and am willing to pay a bit more for that assurance.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
