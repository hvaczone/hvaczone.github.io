If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has actually been burnt out from usage.

Furnaces that kick on regularly might be because of a filthy filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal issue. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps an unclean burner.<p>
