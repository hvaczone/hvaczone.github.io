<h3>Average HVAC Services Offered by a Millersburg OH HVAC Company</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The existing trend in home building is to lower air leak through fractures and other openings in floors, walls, and roofs. The combination of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much greater. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor contaminants and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>
