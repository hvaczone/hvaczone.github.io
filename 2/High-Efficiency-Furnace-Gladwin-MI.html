Air conditioning system assist to dehumidify the incoming air, but in incredibly damp climates or in cases where the a/c unit is large, it may not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the ac system will need more energy to cool your house.

<p>An AC system maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single visit, or you can sign up for a maintenance plan with your local heating and cooling company.

<p>It is common to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady gradually. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material with time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
