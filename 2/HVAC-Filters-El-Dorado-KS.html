<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
