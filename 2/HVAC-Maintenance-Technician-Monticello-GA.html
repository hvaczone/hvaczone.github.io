<p>Remember, too, that you might wish to speak with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump units can have different heating and cooling capacities. If you currently have a home heater, you might try to find a heatpump more tailored toward cooling capability and efficiency. For a higher-end design to look after your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally wish to look for a design that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. Fortunately is that the one major disadvantage of heat pumps is that they can fail in the cold or incredibly hot temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound area.<p>
