<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outdoors - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summertime. These convection heating systems are still commonly used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>Oil heating systems are less typical now than natural gas, however they can be useful in more remote areas where utilities are more difficult to gain access to, and in colder climates because it supplies more heat per BTU than other services.

Overall, they cost between $2,000 and $8,000 to install. Overall, they supply an AFUE rating of in between 80 and 90 percent.<p>
