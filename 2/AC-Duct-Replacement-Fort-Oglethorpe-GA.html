<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summer. Connection issues along the line that provides power to your furnace can jeopardize the efficiency of the unit. Loose, malfunctioning or missing wires will trigger the thermostat to lose its connection to the unit and disrupt service. Part of preserving your furnace includes checking the recommended connections as well as temperature and pressure gauges. Require time to examine these parts for dust and damage, making sure that they are tight and safe.<p>
<p>A SEER rating means Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The SEER rating of an unit is the cooling output at varying temperature levels throughout the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input during the same period. Basically, SEER supplies more data based upon how the EER carries out in different temperatures. The higher the unit's SEER rating, the more energy efficient it is. 1 A system's SEER score can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all devices.<p>

<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs silently and efficiently, but to have two major elements stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the billing prior to work began. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
