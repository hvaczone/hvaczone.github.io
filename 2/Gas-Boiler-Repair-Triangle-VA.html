<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (for the most part) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI protected.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was really practical in gathering information on the phone and supplying clear guidelines about how to briefly deal with the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day.

The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will absolutely utilize Integrity Energy Systems once again, for workplace and home.<p>
