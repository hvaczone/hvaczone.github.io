<p>Most respectable HVAC service technicians will provide complimentary estimates with an in-person service call. Beware of HVAC contractors who attempt to provide you a totally free quote over the phone, as it might not properly show what they will find as soon as they have a look at the system.

<p>Generally the most efficient way to enhance indoor air quality is to remove individual sources of contamination or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be adjusted to reduce the quantity of emissions. In many cases, source control is also a more cost-effective approach to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation due to the fact that increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your home are listed later in this area.<p>
