<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>If the AC does not switch off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't give off heat effectively and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can happen with time due to the fact that of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to work till you purchase a replacement-- which you must do quickly.<p>
<p>Strained Systems Overheat - When your system is dirty, and filters are plugged, and maybe refrigerant is low, it will not be working at maximum efficiency and could overheat. This makes they HVAC system work harder, developing a cycle that does not end. An overworked system will likewise trigger your energy bills to increase. It's possible that the size of AC system you have is not huge enough for your house. If the system is too small, it will need to work harder and might overheat. Typically, an HVAC system costs $4,820 to $9,350 to install a 5-ton unit for a 2,000- to 3,000-square-foot house.<p>
