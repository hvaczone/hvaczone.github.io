<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task finding the outdoor unit as close to your house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.)
