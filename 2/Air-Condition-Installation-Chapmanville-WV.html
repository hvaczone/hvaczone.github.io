<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outdoors - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, specifically in summer. These convection heating systems are still commonly used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>Place the solar storage tank near the conventional water heater. Make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the hot and cold water connections are available if the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank. If the heat exchanger is external to the storage tank, it is likely that it is supported by the pipes. If the tank or heat exchanger ever require to be changed, set up unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut.<p>
