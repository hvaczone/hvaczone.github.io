<p>Last week, Target informed press reporters at The Wall Street Journal and Reuters that the initial invasion into its systems was traced back to network qualifications that were stolen from a third party vendor. Sources now inform KrebsOnSecurity that the supplier in question was an air, refrigeration and heating  conditioning subcontractor that has actually operated at a number of areas at Target and other leading merchants.<p>
<p>Geographically, some locations pay regularly greater wages for air conditioning tradesmen. This might be due to high cost of living, remoteness, undesirable climate, or simply a high level of competitors for skilled trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the country's highest average incomes for HVAC professionals at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 annually. The District of Columbia ranked 2nd, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 per year. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 per year.

EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your threat of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
