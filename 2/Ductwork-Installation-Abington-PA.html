<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall. Since up to 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC unit might be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless unit has an integrated efficiency advantage. Ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions due to the fact that they don't require any brand-new ductwork to be installed.

<p>Furthermore, HVAC organisations typically must pay licensing and certification costs, so be sure to have a look at the specific HVAC licensing requirements in your state.

<p>Whatever heating unit you install, it's vital that it's sized correctly for your home. Too big and you'll be paying more for equipment and installation than you should.

If the market for that energy source turns volatile, rates can change, rates surge and you can end up paying more to heat your home despite how low you set your thermostat.<p>
