The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- since they can be breathed in.

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine components. To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs handled by specialists, see Acme Auto Electric & Repair today.<p>
