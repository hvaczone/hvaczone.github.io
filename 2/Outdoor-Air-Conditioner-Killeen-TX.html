<p>I generally don't leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my options. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over alternatives. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
