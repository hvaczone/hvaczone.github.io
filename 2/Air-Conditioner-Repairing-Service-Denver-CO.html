<p>The probability of immediate responses to indoor air pollutants depends on several factors. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two important influences. In other cases, whether a person responds to a contaminant depends on specific sensitivity, which varies significantly from person to individual. Some people can end up being sensitized to biological pollutants after duplicated exposures, and it appears that some people can become sensitized to chemical toxins as well.<p>
<p>I am extremely satisfied with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years back and know the importance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also impressed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an essential role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of processes which results in the supply and elimination of air from inside a building." Those procedures consist of generating outside air, conditioning it and blending it with indoor air, distributing that air throughout the structure, and moving some part of indoor air exterior. The quality of indoor air will be impacted if one or more of these procedures are underperforming.<p>
