The system can be used to provide hot water along with environment control.

<p>In-floor heater can include certain health benefits. The hotter the air, the drier it ends up being. On those days when you just can't seem to warm up and discover you need to turn up your thermostat, your furnace can draw all the humidity out of your home and leave your sinuses pulsating. In-floor heating systems are not vulnerable to this concern because they heat surface areas and not the air itself.
