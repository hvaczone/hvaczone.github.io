<p>Individuals working in buildings with poor IAQ may discover unpleasant or musty smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are becoming worse, speak to your physician about them. However not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no substitute for excellent structure management.<p>
<p>Second, identification of impurity sources is frequently vital to determining the cause( s) of employee health symptoms. Such info can often be obtained by asking for copies of air monitoring information from the company. If monitoring data is not available, yet a high number of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union agent ought to request that the company have air tracking tests carried out. Evaluation of this information may determine possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. Nevertheless, when pollutant concentrations are very low, monitoring data may not discuss the observed or reported health signs.<p>
