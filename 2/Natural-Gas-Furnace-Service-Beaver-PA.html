<h3>Why Fall Is Your Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System in Beaver PA</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to eliminate the old water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heater. We chose getting something more costly than a conventional water heater as gas is one of our biggest energy expenses. We feel that this new unit will last a very long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>

A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, consisting of installation. Whole-house systems, on the other hand, range in cost from $2,500 to $7,500, including installation.
