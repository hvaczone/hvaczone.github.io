<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the home.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you would not offer them.. Second of all like extended vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly unfortunate.
