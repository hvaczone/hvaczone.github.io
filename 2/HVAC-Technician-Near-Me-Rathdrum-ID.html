Professionals are frequently needed to operate in confined locations, on high ladders near ceilings, or on the roofing systems of houses.

<p>If you operate in building and construction, demolition, painting, with batteries, in a radiator repair shop or lead factory, or your pastime involves lead, you may unknowingly bring lead into your house on your clothes or hands.

Soil by roadways and highways may be polluted from years of exhaust fumes from cars and trucks that used leaded gas. Use door mats to clean your feet before getting in the home.
