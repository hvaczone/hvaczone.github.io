Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile hose) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
