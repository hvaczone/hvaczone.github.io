<h3>Recognizing the Significance of HVAC Systems at Fulton NY</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was fast and extremely clear about his examination, guaranteeing I understood what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the room temperature level, and after that switch it ON. To prevent straining an a/c unit's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>

What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my options. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about options. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family pal and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
