<p>Recent Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
