<p>Individuals operating in buildings with poor IAQ may discover undesirable or musty smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to good structure management.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
