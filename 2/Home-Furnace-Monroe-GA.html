<h3>Elements of a High Efficiency Furnace in Monroe GA</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to get rid of the old water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heater. We decided on getting something more pricey than a conventional hot water heater as gas is among our most significant utility expenses. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
