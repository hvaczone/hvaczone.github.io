<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should temporarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
