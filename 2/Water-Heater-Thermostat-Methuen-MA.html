<h2>How To Hire Affordable HVAC Service in Methuen</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>All homes need effective ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has actually been stressed out from use. Another possible reason could be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from adjusting to the right temperature. Heaters that kick on often may be due to a filthy filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps a dirty burner.<p>

The only genuine exception to this would be a geothermal heatpump system.
