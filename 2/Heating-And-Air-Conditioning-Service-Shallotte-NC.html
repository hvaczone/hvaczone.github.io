<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace technicians often find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and young kids can be serious. They consist of delays in physical and psychological development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Infants, fetuses, and children are more susceptible to lead exposure than adults because lead is more easily absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more conscious the harmful results of lead. Kids may have higher exposures since they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>
