<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either because of visible growth or a moldy smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and keep. Leaking return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
