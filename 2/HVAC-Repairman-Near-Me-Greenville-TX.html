<h3>The Way to Avoid Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Greenville TX</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even little window package systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like material, and need to be replaced or cleaned as conditions call for. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will need to have the filters altered more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy expenses; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Additionally, extremely unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
