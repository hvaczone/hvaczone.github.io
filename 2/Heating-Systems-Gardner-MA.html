<p>All Points Heating uses home cooling, a/c installation, air conditioning system maintenance that deliver dependable, tested efficiency at high performance. Combustion items from car exhaust, heating systems, hot water heater, area heating systems, aromatic candle lights, oil lamps, wood stoves, fireplaces, and gas stoves that are not properly vented can generate carbon monoxide gas, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and respirable particulates.
