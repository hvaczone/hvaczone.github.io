Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in sufficient outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the home. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a variety of different heater, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems operate on similar principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system warms by dispersing hot water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the room.<p>
