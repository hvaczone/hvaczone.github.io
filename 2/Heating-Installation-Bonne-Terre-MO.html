<h3>Methods To Get the Most out of Your HVAC System in Bonne Terre MO</h3>
<p>Many people understand that outdoor air pollution can impact their health, however indoor air contamination can also have substantial, damaging effect. EPA studies of human exposure to air contaminants suggest that indoor levels of pollutants might be two to five times-- and occasionally more than 100 times-- greater than outdoor levels. The EPA and its Science Advisory Board regularly rank indoor air pollution among the top five environmental health dangers to the public.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. If your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most cost effective. Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the requirement to set up a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
