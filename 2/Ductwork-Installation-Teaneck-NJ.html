<h3>The Most Common Causes of Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The existing pattern in home building is to decrease air leak through cracks and other openings in floors, walls, and roofing systems. The combination of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually resulted in an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh makeup air waters down indoor pollutants and helps tire them from the house.<p>
<p>Some sources, such as building materials, furnishings, and household items like air fresheners, release pollutants more or less constantly. Other sources, associated to activities performed in the home, release contaminants intermittently. These consist of cigarette smoking, using unvented or malfunction-ing ranges, heaters, or space heaters, the use of solvents in cleaning and hobby activities, the use of paint strippers in remodeling activities, and the use of cleaning products and pesticides in house cleaning. High pollutant concentrations can remain in the air for long periods after some of these activities.<p>
