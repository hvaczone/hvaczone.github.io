Start to compare the cost of your current heating expenses with heating bills from the previous years. It's time to change your furnace if there is a significant distinction.<p>

Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your threat of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
