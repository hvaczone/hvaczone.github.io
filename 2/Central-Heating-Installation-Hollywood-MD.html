<p>People operating in structures with bad IAQ might see musty or undesirable smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your doctor about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no replacement for excellent structure management.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine parts. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs handled by professionals, see Acme Car Electric & Repair today.<p>
