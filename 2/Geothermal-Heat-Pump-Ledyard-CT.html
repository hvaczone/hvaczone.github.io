<h3>Boiler Repair and Water Boiler Issues in Ledyard CT</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Oil heaters tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a lot of soot, which requires to be appropriately vented and cleaned up from the furnace frequently. Change the filters periodically and have your ductwork cleaned up since the soot develops inside the ducts, lowering their efficiency in time. Anticipate to service your furnace yearly at a cost of around $200, change your filters every 1 - 3 months, and clean your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running efficiently.<p>

<p>The split system is the most common. Most people are used to seeing this type in the backyards of houses. With split system units, most of the parts are housed in a metal box outside of the house. Nevertheless, there are some internal parts also. Split systems are ideal for cooling multiple rooms at the same time, but are not really energy effective.
