<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How climate change impacts air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for contemporary ac system) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c boost. This boost has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit removes that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system should increase its power usage by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>

Carbon dioxide at levels that are unusually high indoors may cause occupants to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are normally 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level thought about acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the primary indoor source of carbon dioxide in the majority of buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are a sign of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
