<p>Wetness management and humidity control needs running HVAC systems as designed. Moisture management and humidity control might contravene efforts to try to optimize the operation to save energy. For instance, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide cosmetics air at lower temperature levels (style levels), rather of the greater temperature levels sometimes utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, for the majority of the US and many parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need further cooling to provide thermal comfort indoors.
