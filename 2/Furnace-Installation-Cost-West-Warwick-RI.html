<p>Packaged terminal a/c unit (PTAC) systems are likewise known as wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have 2 separate systems (terminal bundles), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and permits each space to be changed individually. PTAC systems might be adapted to provide heating in cold weather, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, transforming the a/c into a heatpump While room cooling offers maximum flexibility, when utilized to cool many rooms at a time it is normally more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>
