<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. When I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the rate excellent however Mark headed out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
