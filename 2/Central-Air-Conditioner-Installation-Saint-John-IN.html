<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you must check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
