Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. Meanwhile, in huge box stores like Finest Buy, package fans and window AC systems are snatched up as quickly as they're stacked in floor screens. Seattle might be the last city in the nation to face the reality of a terrible, vicious summer season.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious factor affecting indoor air quality, however it is frequently utilized as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level.
