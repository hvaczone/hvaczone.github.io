<p>How climate change affects air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for modern-day air conditioning system) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c increase.

As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The ac system's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
