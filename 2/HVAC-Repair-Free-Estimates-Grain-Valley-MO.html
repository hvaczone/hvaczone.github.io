<h3>Air Condition Repair in Grain Valley Missouri</h3>
<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either because of noticeable growth or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't eliminate the mold.

The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and keep. Leaky return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
