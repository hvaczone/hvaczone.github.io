<p>There are a couple of possibilities to explain short cycling in really winter. The most obvious is the possibility of the high needs put on the system due to the extremely low temperature levels.

There are other possibilities such as a fracture in the heat exchanger or a broken thermostat. If you require clarity on this issue, contact one of our service technicians.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by building and construction, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into structures through mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>After the system has been checked for leaks, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that features fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be secured by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside need to be secured with PVC insulation covers.<p>
