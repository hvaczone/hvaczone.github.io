<p>As a lot of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant equipment manufacturer's to guarantee your factory guarantees remain in place. Additionally, the tangible results of a PM is often difficult to measure, as one reaction mentioned the cost savings in efficiency or repairs that were avoided. Most pieces of a furnace or a/c don't simply break at the snap of a finger, but rather is the outcome of recurring usage of an element that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon since the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and triggering early degeneration, leading to cracks and holes.
