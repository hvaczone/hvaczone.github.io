<p>I typically do not leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You do not anticipate having to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my options. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss options. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>Employ professionals and treat them well: Inspired, well-compensated professionals perform better work than transient subcontractors who have little stake in a company's success. An ethical company doesn't exploit low-cost labor chances just because they're cheap. Economical craftsmanship is generally inferior workmanship, and it never helps a company build long-lasting relationships with clients.<p>
<p>Filters can get unclean easily, particularly if you live in an area that can be dirty. The HVAC system filters trap all sort of dust, particles, bacteria, and tidy the air. They're responsible for keeping the indoor air quality. Your HVAC system will ultimately stop performing as you expect it to if they're not cleaned and replaced regularly. The heating & cooling will mishandle and the indoor air quality will get worse. Checking and altering the air filters is one of the most important elements of HVAC maintenance.<p>
<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol result, many commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from badly placed or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which frequently launch water in an aerosol which might go into nearby ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical facilities and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outside water fountains in public tourist attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy direct exposure to acquire infection.<p>
