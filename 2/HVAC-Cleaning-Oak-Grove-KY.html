<h3>Things to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service in Oak Grove KY</h3>

We have the experience and resources necessary to assist from the planning phases through to the final installation.

<p>Examine these three things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the signs up in your home are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). The lowered air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of registers were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's great airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually resolved the issue.<p>
