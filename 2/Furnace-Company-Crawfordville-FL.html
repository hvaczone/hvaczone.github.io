<p>Old lead-based paint is the most substantial source of lead direct exposure in the U.S. today. Damaging exposures to lead can be produced when lead-based paint is poorly eliminated from surfaces by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning.

The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c unit works however the house does not cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
