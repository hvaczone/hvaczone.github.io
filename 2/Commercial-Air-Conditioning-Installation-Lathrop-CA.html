<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, carried out a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by improving air flow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy performance. In many cases, determined particle levels in fact increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is typically an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
