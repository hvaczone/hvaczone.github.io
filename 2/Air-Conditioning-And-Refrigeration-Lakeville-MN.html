<p>Specific instant impacts are similar to those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is often hard to determine if the symptoms are an outcome of exposure to indoor air pollution.

If the signs fade or disappear when an individual is away from the location, for instance, an effort needs to be made to recognize indoor air sources that might be possible causes.

If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
