Much like other kinds of heatpump, ground source heatpump have their geothermal effectiveness rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE OFFICER). COP rates just how much heat a system gets rid of or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to develop the heating or cooling effect.
