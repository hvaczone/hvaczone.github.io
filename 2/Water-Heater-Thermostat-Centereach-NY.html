In other words, they are best for our Seattle environment! They are extremely effective, beating out most other types of heating systems in performance.

Local bathroom or cooking area fans that tire outdoors get rid of contaminants directly from the room where the fan lies and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
