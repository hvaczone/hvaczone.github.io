<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- provide All Vovo a call! Heat pumps work extremely well in temperate environments like King and South Snohomish counties. Operating on electricity, a heatpump is an affordable solution using a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your fridge, but in reverse.

Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
