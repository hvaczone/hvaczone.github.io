<p>Structures are designed or intended to respond actively to a few of these modifications around them with heating, cooling, aerating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean up, sterilize, and keep surface areas to enhance their durability, appearance, or performance. In other cases, such modifications subtly or even dramatically alter structures in ways that may be necessary to their own integrity or their effect on structure occupants through the advancement of the physical, chemical, and biological procedures that define them at any time. We might find it useful to integrate the tools of the physical sciences with those of the life sciences and, especially, a few of the methods used by researchers studying communities, in order to acquire a boosted understanding of the environments in which we invest most of our time, our buildings.<p>

<p>Allergens are materials that trigger an immune-type reaction in people who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants discovered in indoor air are mainly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can become airborne, and thus, are easily breathed in. Allergens that are inhaled by sensitized people with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For instance, if you think about a group of people with asthma, the existence of cat irritant could bring on an asthma attack in individuals with feline allergic reactions, but not in those people who do not have feline allergic reactions.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants include germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; infections are sent by animals and people; bacteria are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can end up being airborne. Polluted central air handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these contaminants through the house.<p>
