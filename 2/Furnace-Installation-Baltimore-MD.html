Up until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however nowadays, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling bills than devices installed just a few years back.<p>

<p>EER means Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning units is measured by the variety of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people don't utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Allergens are materials that trigger an immune-type reaction in individuals who are sensitized to these materials. Allergens found in indoor air are primarily biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these products are small particles, can become air-borne, and thus, are easily breathed in. Allergens that are inhaled by sensitized individuals with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For example, if you think about a group of people with asthma, the existence of cat allergen could induce an asthma attack in people with cat allergic reactions, but not in those individuals who do not have feline allergies.<p>
<p>No matter what kind of heating system you have in your house, you can conserve cash and increase your convenience by properly keeping and updating your devices. However remember, an energy-efficient furnace alone will not have as excellent an impact on your energy costs as utilizing the whole-house approach By combining appropriate devices maintenance and upgrades with suggested insulation, air sealing, and thermostat settings, you can conserve about 30% on your energy costs while reducing ecological emissions.<p>
