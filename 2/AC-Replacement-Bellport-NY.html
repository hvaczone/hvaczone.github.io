Legionnaires Illness is an example of BRI brought on by germs which can contaminate a structure's air conditioning system.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a big central air conditioner unit that sits outdoors your house. Heat pumps operate on electrical power and work like air conditioning system in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air.
