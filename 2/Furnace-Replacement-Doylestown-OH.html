<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
