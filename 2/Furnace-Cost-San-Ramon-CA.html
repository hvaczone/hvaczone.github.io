<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to alter your filters regularly, they're not joking. It's as essential as a regular oil change in your vehicle. A dirty filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, clean filter better traps contaminants and debris in the air. As soon as every three months, Energy Star suggests changing your filter. Throughout high usage months, inspect the filters a minimum of monthly.<p>

<h3>Frequent Causes of Air Conditioning Repair Calls in San Ramon CA</h3>
<p>Another approach to reducing the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your home is to increase the amount of outdoor air coming indoors. Many house heating and cooling systems, including forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather permits, or running a window ac system with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen fans that exhaust outdoors get rid of impurities straight from the room where the fan is located and likewise increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>There's a big difference in between the heat transfer of radiation and the other typical type of house heating-- convection. Over the past century, the majority of houses in colder environments were warmed by convection, rather than radiation. Convection is the process of heating air and blowing it about the rooms for the warm air to keep the walls, ceilings and floorings heated. In turn, the items in the space, like furnishings and people, would stay warm by virtue of the air temperature.<p>

If one or more of these procedures are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be affected.<p>
