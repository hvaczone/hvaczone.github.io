<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>
<p>Air toxins can range from pollutants brought in from the outdoors by your animals to unsafe gas leakages. Carbon monoxide is a typical air pollutant resulting from natural gas that leaves into your house without being burnt. Older homes may contain asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when launched into the air. In bathrooms and cooking areas, mold and mildew can become an annoyance where wetness levels are generally greater than in the rest of your house.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, frequently described as central air" or split-system a/c", distribute cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the ceilings, walls, or floors covered by grills) bring cooled air from the air conditioning unit to the home. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it flows through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Find out how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
