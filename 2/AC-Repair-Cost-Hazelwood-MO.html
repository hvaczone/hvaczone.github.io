<h3>Window Air Conditioner in Hazelwood MO 63042</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heatpump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also changes functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>I am replacing our High Velocity System because of a severe refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted equipment, a Carrier, Comfort Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also installing an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER.

They will likewise reuse the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will also install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I likewise have a choice for an extra $2,818.00 to install a Provider Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
