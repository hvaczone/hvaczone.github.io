<h3>AC Repair Contractor in Dobson NC 27017</h3>

What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my alternatives. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss alternatives. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me regarding an uncommonly high costs that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he understood that I had called the service manager and left a message of issue.
