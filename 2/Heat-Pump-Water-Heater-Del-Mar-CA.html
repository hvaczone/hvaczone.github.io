The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it distributes through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils.

The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
