What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my alternatives. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss options. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
