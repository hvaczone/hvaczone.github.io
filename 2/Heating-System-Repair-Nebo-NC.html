<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI protected.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals.

If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do decline them until they have been properly dried. Attempt a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
