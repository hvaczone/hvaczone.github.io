Throughout use, there is a dead time while heat is being carried from the heating unit to the home.<p>
<p>These guys have actually been great. At a real estate agent, I sometimes need contractors to provide me a viewpoint for what work on a house may cost. Just recently I required to contact these guys twice. They came out quickly and offered me a no nonsense estimate for the work.
