<p>The split system is the most common. The majority of people are used to seeing this key in the backyards of houses.

<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for a/c repair, which you should look out for. First, you need to examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
