Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety changes that protect your air conditioning system from flooding. One of the most common areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is an excellent opportunity; you might have a water leakage in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen.
