<p>Practically half of Americans utilize air fresheners at least when a week, and 34 percent usage candle lights or incense that often, our nationally representative study found. Approximately 40 percent seldom or never clean their humidifier or kitchen variety hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have never ever cleaned up or changed their furnace filter. And almost 20 percent still smoke in your home or let others smoke there. All of those things can get worse indoor air quality.<p>
