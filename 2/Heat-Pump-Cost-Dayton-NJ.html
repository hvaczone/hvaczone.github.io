<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your house at optimal effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will require a much bigger AC system than a smaller sized house, which will impact installation expenses. Also a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air circulation will require far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfy. Other elements that can impact this might be the insulation elsewhere such as the foundation, roof, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>Geothermal heatpump can be quickly incorporated with existing systems such as traditional forced air or radiant flooring heating or can be installed in a brand-new structure. Required air systems will require a water-to-air heat pump while hydronic radiant heating systems will require water-to-water heatpump. The size of geothermal heat pump and the size of ground loop needed depends upon the heating and cooling requirements for your home and is crucial iin guaranteeing the efficiency and performance of the system. Capacity for geothermal systems is determined in heaps. Usually, a 3-ton setup should be sufficient for the typical house, however house size, heating and cooling requirements, local geology and soil, and land accessibility are all factors which will influence the correct size for your specific house. Energy Environmental Corporation is experienced in geothermal heat pump installation and can help you properly size a system.<p>

If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
