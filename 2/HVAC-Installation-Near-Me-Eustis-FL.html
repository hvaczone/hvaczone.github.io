<p>Consider an entire home dehumidifier if your single phase air conditioner isn't old enough to validate replacement. By installing dehumidification equipment inside an existing single stage system, you can enjoy some of the advantages of a variable speed compressor without changing any devices. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfy level, enhancing indoor air quality and making it possible for greater comfort at higher temperature levels.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should briefly change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
