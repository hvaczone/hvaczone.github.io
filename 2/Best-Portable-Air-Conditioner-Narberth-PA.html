<p>Radiant heating covers a series of various heating systems, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems operate on comparable principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats up by distributing hot water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
