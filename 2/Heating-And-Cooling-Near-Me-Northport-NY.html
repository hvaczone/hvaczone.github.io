<h3>The Way to Have the Best Gas Furnace For Your Home in Northport NY</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the entire day as they needed to get rid of the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating system. We decided on getting something more expensive than a traditional water heater as gas is among our most significant utility expenses. We feel that this new unit will last a long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>
