<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you would not provide them.  Second of all like extended vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the needed skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat customers fairly. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be totally benefited from. The majority of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly found someone to appropriately service and the unit has been running problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

Carbon monoxide gas is a common air toxin resulting from natural gas that leaves into your house without being burnt. Older homes might contain asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when released into the air. In restrooms and cooking areas, mold and mildew can become a nuisance where wetness levels are typically higher than in the rest of your house.<p>
