<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn In Your Air Conditioner at Albany NY</h3>
<p>Sean was really helpful. He is an extremely enjoyable person to work with. No pressure applied to purchase additional stuff. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no concerns other than the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the space temperature, and then switch it ON. To prevent straining an a/c's compressor, wait at least five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, try to find an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
