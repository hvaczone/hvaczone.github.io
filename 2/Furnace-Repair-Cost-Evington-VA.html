For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged duration of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure carbon dioxide ought to be adjusted regularly, and outdoor measurements utilized for estimations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors might also be essential.<p>
