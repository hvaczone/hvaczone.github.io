<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pressing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them till they have actually been properly dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up. Try a various dry cleaner if products with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>

There is presently no evidence, however, that an affordable number of houseplants remove substantial quantities of pollutants in houses and workplaces.
