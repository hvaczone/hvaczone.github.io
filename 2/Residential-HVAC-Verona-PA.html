<p>Some a/c systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise changes functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>

<p>Next, and possibly just as important when it concerns central air costs, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too large will have an easy time keeping the house cool, but will have a more difficult time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not have the ability to appropriately cool the home on hot days. Considering larger units cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
