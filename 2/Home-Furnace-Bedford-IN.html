<h3>Compact Air Conditioner in Bedford Indiana</h3>
<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either because of visible growth or a musty smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and keep.
