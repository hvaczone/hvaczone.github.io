<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality in Edmonds WA</h3>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps are incredibly efficient, because ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature is constantly at a consistent temperature level. These systems can obtain a geothermal efficiency of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heatpump can only attain an efficiency of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter.

Now the "hard part" once a year turned off the electrical power open the furnace and very thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
