All five other companies estimated me with different costs and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who explained to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. When I called and he recommended me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working once again, he helped me problem shoot the problem.
