<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

The quality of indoor air will be affected if one or more of these procedures are underperforming.<p>
