<p>Acknowledged as a leader in the HVAC market, Bard Production combines quality items and exceptional service with development and technological advances to deliver high-performance cooling and heating products around the globe. A multi-split system 56 is a conventional split system, which is divided into 2 parts (evaporator and condenser) and permits cooling or heating of several rooms with one external system.

<p>For instance, problems develop when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not used to bring in appropriate amounts of outside air.

<p>Since an a/c moves heat in between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both should be kept clean. This suggests that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also essential to regularly clean the condenser coil.
