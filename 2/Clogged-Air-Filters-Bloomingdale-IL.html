<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle ac system". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise changes functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>In addition, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces heated by radiators are prone to cold spots", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and very hot next to the radiators. This normally leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to heat up your house escape out of the window. Convected heat provides warmth from the flooring up throughout the room with no cold areas or stuffiness in the area being heated.<p>
