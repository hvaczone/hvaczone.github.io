Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the lowered airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's great airflow at the registers.

<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have concerns, they offer me priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>
