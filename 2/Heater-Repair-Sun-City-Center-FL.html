This decreases the interior system footprint and permits each room to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems might be adapted to provide heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioning unit into a heat pump While space a/c supplies maximum flexibility, when used to cool numerous spaces at a time it is typically more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
