<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heatpump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
