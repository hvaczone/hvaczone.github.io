<p>Recognized as a leader in the HVAC industry, Bard Production combines quality products and outstanding service with innovation and technological advances to deliver high-performance heating & cooling items around the world. A multi-split system 56 is a traditional split system, which is divided into 2 parts (evaporator and condenser) and permits cooling or heating of several spaces with one external system. In the outside unit of this ac system there is a more effective compressor, ports for connecting several traces and automation with locking valves for managing the volume of refrigerant provided to the indoor systems found in the space.<p>
<p>The primary issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones.

Setting up a multi-split system produces more troubles, because a few of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the a/c separately for each room. However, now the marketplace has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor units operate separately from each other.<p>
