<p>3. Gas Furnaces While the cost of heating your home with a gas furnace is generally greater than many heatpump choices, they can still be extremely effective, depending upon the model you purchase. Among the primary benefits of gas heating is that due to the combustion process, it will heat the air to greater temperatures than other heating alternatives. This suggests it can warm up your house to the desired temperature quicker than a heatpump can.<p>
