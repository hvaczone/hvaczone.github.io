<p>How climate modification impacts air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for modern-day air conditioners) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner boost. This boost has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner need to increase its power intake by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the a/c has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The ac system's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
