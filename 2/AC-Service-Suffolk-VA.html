<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible growth or a moldy smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and preserve. Dripping return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you think a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>

<p>Home heating systems are complicated systems that require the services of a contractor to install. While you can definitely acquire your furnace yourself, many contractors won't service warranty the furnace or may not install it if you do not buy it from them.

<p>Central air is a luxury not everyone can pay for, numerous Seattleites need to find ways to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. On the other hand, in big box shops like Best Buy, the box fans and window AC units are taken up as soon as they're stacked in flooring display screens. Seattle may be the last city in the country to face the reality of a cruel, terrible summer season.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
