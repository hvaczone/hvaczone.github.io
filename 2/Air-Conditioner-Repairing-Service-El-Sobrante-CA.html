<p>An indoor air contaminant is a compound in the air that may impact the health of individuals who reside in the home. Pollutants might come from outside the home-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in an attached garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon entering your home from the ground listed below. An air pollutant might likewise come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a faulty furnace, unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted space, secondhand smoke, mold growing on wet or damp carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, home cleaning, or individual care items. Bacteria and viruses, pet dander, and bug parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more tough to control than they seem due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity needs to be maintained at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to decrease mold growth.<p>
