Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things first. Ensure all the registers in the house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was clogged, the reduced air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've solved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
