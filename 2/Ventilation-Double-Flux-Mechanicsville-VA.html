<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you should inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
