<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
