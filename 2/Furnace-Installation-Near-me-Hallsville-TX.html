<p>A heating and air-conditioning contractor sizes the furnace to your home's square video footage. They utilize a series of calculations based upon the British Thermal Units or BTUs required to heat the area. The larger the space, the more effective the house heating system requires to be.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must briefly switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
