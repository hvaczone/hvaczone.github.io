This is typically used in a third-floor or second area and takes advantage of the flooring joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and additional density of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber glowing flooring heat hydronic system efficient, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipelines to direct heat upward.<p>
