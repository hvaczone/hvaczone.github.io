<p>5. Odor great naturally. You might associate that lemony or piney scent with a clean kitchen or tidy artificial scents in laundry items and air fresheners release dozens of different chemicals into the air.

<p>3. Gas Furnaces While the cost of heating your home with a gas furnace is generally higher than many heatpump choices, they can still be extremely effective, depending upon the model you purchase.

Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not generating adequate outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
