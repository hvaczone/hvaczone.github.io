<p>I usually don't leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to change your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my choices. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about choices. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>

The heat exchanger permits air to be warmed without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct, supplying warm air to individual bedrooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
