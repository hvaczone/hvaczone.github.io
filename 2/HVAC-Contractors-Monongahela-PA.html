<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets requests for assessment and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies.

Nevertheless, a lot of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up many years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
