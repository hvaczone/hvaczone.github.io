Part of preserving your furnace includes examining the advised connections in addition to temperature and pressure determines. Take time to examine these parts for dust and damage, making certain that they are tight and protected.<p>
<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Unclean filters are the most common reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your house won't heat up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A filthy filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
