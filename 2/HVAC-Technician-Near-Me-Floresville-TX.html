<p>Current Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
