<h3>Heat Pump Installation in North Port Florida</h3>

<p>Most central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the ac system works however the house does not cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
