Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
<p>The impacts of lead exposure on fetuses and young children can be severe. They include delays in physical and psychological advancement, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Infants, kids, and fetuses are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than grownups since lead is more easily soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more conscious the harmful effects of lead.

<p>New air conditioning unit normally vary from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A greater SEER rating implies greater energy performance and potentially lower energy bills.

<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning unit (PTAC) systems are also referred to as wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often utilized in hotels, have 2 separate systems (terminal plans), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening travelling through the wall and linking them. This lessens the interior system footprint and allows each space to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems might be adapted to supply heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, converting the ac system into a heatpump While room cooling supplies optimum flexibility, when used to cool many spaces at a time it is generally more expensive than central air.<p>
