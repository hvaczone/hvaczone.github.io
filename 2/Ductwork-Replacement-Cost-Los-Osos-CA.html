You can usually conclude that the capacitor has stopped working.

<p>RMI is working to change that, beginning in California. As a primary step, in April RMI affirmed before the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set stronger indoor standards based on the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to regulate indoor devices through codes, and after more powerful standards are set there is a chance to work on enforcement.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up, do not accept them until they have been effectively dried. Try a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent sees.<p>
