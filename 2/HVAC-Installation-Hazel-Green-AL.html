<h3>Common Causes of Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Hazel Green AL</h3>
<p>Spot Ventilation. Exterior exhaust fans ought to be installed in all bathrooms and cooking areas. These fans get rid of humidity and carbon monoxide. The most effective fans are peaceful and long lasting. Use fans that run at one sone or less and exhaust to the outdoors. Fans equipped with timers or de-humidistat controls work to ensure the fans run for a sufficient amount of time. A great rule of thumb is to run a bathroom fan for about 45 minutes after a shower.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the eye, nose, and throat and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of breathing infection; there is also evidence from animal studies that repeated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at specific danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and people with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
