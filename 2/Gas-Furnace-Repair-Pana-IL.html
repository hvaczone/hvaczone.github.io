A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine parts. To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced routinely.

<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They offer me priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I do not need.<p>
