<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They offer me priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I do not need.<p>
