<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
