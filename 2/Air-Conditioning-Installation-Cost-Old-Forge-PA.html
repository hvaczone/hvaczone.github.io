<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not use them.  Second of all like prolonged auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the essential skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be totally benefited from. The majority of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to effectively service and the system has actually been running problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
