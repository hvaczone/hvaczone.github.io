<p>SysTech Style concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it distributes through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils.

It also prevents water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer season a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
