<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
