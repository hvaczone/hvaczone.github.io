<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Proper Duct Sealing in Owens Cross Roads AL</h3>
<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He devoted to the task based only on emails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the couple of sensible ones got. Others were almost two times the amount Protex quoted for low end off brand devices. I got Provider. ProTex correctly encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Honesty) The install group was considerate of my home and installed the equipment in the anticipated amount of time. post install inspection outcomes look very good for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools far better than the 13 year old 4 load R22 unit it replaced (likewise Carrier).<p>
<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
