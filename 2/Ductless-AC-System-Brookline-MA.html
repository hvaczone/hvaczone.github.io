<p>If your air conditioner is more than eight years of ages, repair is most likely not worth the expense, unless it's an easy issue like particles clogging the condenser unit or a used fan belt. Still, to finest weigh your repair-or-replace decision, ask your contractor to examine not just the condition of your existing equipment, but also the ducts that provide the cool air and the total quality of the insulation in your house. Improving those aspects might increase the effectiveness of the system as much or more than installing new machinery.<p>
<p>The fuel lines that supply gas to your furnace must also be checked regularly. Leaking gas and fuel can be a fire risk. Disconnected fuel lines can jeopardize the effectiveness of the HVAC system too. Soot can collect in burners and broken heat exchanger s can have an effect on the system's performance as well. The maintenance. specialists will examine all of these aspects of the furnace and thoroughly and get rid of all clogs and traces of soot.<p>
<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer car debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash coming in every month, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to provide auto debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There need to not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>
