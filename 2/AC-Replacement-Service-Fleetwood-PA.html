<h3>Water Source Heat Pump in Fleetwood Pennsylvania</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the home.<p>
