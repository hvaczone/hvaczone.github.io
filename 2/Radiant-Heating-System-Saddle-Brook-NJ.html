Older systems from the 1970s might be rated 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is wasted during the combustion process. Today's designs vary from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your home currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a relatively straightforward process. If you are including on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting, installing a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather costly.<p>

<p>More often, nevertheless, detectives will need to come to the building to carry out personal interviews with residents, to look for possible sources of the issues, and to inspect the style and operation of the ventilation system and other building functions.
