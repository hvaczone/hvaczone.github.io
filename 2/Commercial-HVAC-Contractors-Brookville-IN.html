Every person I have handled is friendly and professional. The techs are timely, polite and effective. They aim to finish every job as quickly as possible and understand our budgetary needs on all 5 of the commercial homes on which I help with the management.<p>
<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
