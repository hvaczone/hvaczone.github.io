<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as reasonably the same physical product in time.

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
