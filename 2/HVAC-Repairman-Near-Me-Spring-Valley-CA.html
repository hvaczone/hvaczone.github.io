<p>Moisture management and humidity control requires running HVAC systems as designed. Wetness management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to try to enhance the operation to save energy. For instance, moisture management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply makeup air at lower temperature levels (design levels), rather of the greater temperatures often utilized to conserve energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the US and many parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need additional cooling to supply thermal convenience inside your home. However, high humidity outdoors creates the need for mindful attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities trigger mold development and moisture inside is associated with a greater prevalence of resident breathing issues.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, implying they utilize air to exchange heat, in the exact same way as a cars and truck radiator or typical household air conditioning system does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It gathers water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which needs to be vented outside the cooled location; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled location to the outdoors air.<p>
