<p>It is common to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical product over time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
