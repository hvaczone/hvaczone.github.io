<p>The properties and composition of the soil in an area can affect the rate at which heat is carried out through the ground. These need to be considered before selecting the very best design of an underground heating & cooling system. Soil with favorable heat transfer homes requires fewer pipelines to accomplish the wanted underground heating and cooling effect, while those with decreased thermal conductivity will need more pipelines.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its efficiency.<p>
