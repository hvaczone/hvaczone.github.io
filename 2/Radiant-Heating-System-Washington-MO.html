Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has actually watched the single-family home installation business completely flip on its head the last few years. Winter season utilized to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their traditionally two-week AC installation wait times swelling to up to three months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and individuals." And not just with newbies more accustomed to AC living.

Also, clean ducts and appropriate air flow are vital to a well-functioning system, but property owners do not have the essential equipment for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy property owner, it's still necessary to have a professional technician inspect the system occasionally.<p>
