<h3>Air Conditioner Parts in Abbeville SC 29620</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have heard of the $5000 rule however got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
