When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact eliminate millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
<p>In a packaged central air conditioning conditioner, the condenser, evaporator, and compressor are all located in one cabinet, which normally is put on a roofing system or on a concrete piece beside the house's foundation.

<p>I normally don't leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my choices. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss alternatives. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
