<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, transmitting the absorbed heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas.

From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating unit.<p>
