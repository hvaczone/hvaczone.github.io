<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. When I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the price excellent however Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
