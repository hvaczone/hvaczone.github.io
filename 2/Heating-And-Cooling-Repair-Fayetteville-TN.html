<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might require a referral in the future). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've switched all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>

<p>Have utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They provide me top priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good financial investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to offer me something I don't require.<p>
