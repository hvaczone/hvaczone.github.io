This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical product gradually. In reality, the real nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding.
