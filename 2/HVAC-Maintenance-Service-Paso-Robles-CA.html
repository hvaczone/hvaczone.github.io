<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning in Your Paso Robles CA Home</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government company, carried out a study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by improving airflow.

In many cases, determined particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
