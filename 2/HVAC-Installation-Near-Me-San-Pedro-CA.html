<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives requests for consultation and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation procedure. However, much of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up many years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<h3>Three Crucial Spring Furnace Maintenance Tips in San Pedro CA</h3>
<p>All contemporary cooling systems, even little window bundle systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like product, and should be replaced or cleaned as conditions require. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will require to have the filters altered more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Additionally, extremely unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He knew just what the problem was and repaired it extremely quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
