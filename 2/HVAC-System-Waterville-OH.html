An oversize compressor also costs more to run because it simply takes more electrical energy to run a larger system. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity effectively. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has a possibility to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary wetness. The outcome is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level shows. In reality, the space can feel moist and clammy.<p>
