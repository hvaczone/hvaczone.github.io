<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to temporarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
