<p>The primary health effect associated with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year.
