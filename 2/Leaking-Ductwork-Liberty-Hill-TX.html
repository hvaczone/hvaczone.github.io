<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a large central air conditioner system that sits outside your home.

<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a moldy odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and maintain. Leaky return ducts can also present moisture. Once again, if you think a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>Lots of indoor air contaminants originate from the kitchen area. Gas stoves release damaging impurities, consisting of carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide.
