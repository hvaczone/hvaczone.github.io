<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the job based only on e-mails, showed up and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the few reasonable ones received. Others were almost twice the quantity Protex priced estimate for low end off brand devices. I got Carrier. ProTex appropriately advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The install team was considerate of my home and set up the equipment in the expected amount of time. post install evaluation outcomes look excellent for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools much better than the 13 years of age 4 lot R22 system it replaced (also Carrier).<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He understood simply what the problem was and fixed it extremely rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
