<p>Central air conditioning is a high-end not everyone can afford, so many Seattleites must discover ways to combat the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. On the other hand, in big box stores like Best Buy, the box fans and window AC systems are nabbed up as soon as they're stacked in floor display screens. Seattle might be the last city in the nation to face the reality of a cruel, terrible summertime.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
