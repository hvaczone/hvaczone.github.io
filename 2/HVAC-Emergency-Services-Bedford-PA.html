<h3>The History of Air Source Heat Pumps at Bedford PA</h3>
<p>All modern cooling systems, even little window bundle systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or washed as conditions require. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters altered more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. In addition, extremely filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
