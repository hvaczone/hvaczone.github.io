<h3>Different types of HVAC Repairs in Bellflower CA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was fast and extremely clear about his inspection, ensuring I comprehended what was watched out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
