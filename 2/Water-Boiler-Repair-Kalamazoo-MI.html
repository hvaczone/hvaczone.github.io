<p>The function of the majority of structure ventilation systems is to generate appropriate fresh air for occupant comfort while controlling temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and building security at reasonable energy costs. Load calculating is described as the Manual J estimation and must be carried out by the HVAC contractor prior to giving an installation or unit cost for cooling.
