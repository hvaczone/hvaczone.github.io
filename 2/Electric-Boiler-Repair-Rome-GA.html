<p>I am replacing our High Velocity System due to the fact that of a severe refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted equipment, a Carrier, Convenience Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also installing an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be including three (3) high speed supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will likewise recycle the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will also install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an option for an additional $2,818.00 to install a Provider Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>If the AC does not switch off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't emit heat effectively and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can take place with time since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to do the trick until you purchase a replacement-- which you should do quickly.<p>
