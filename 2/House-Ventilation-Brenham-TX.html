<h3>The History of Air Source Heat Pumps in Brenham TX</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to eliminate the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heating unit.

We feel that this brand-new system will last a very long time and usage extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
