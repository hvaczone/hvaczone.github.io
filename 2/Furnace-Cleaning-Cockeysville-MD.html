AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of common a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years approximately. Unscrew the old AC contactor before removing the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Picture 6).<p>

Natural ventilation plans can utilize very little energy, but care needs to be required to ensure comfort. In warm or damp climates, preserving thermal comfort entirely through natural ventilation may not be possible. A/c systems are utilized, either as supplements or backups. Air-side economizers also utilize outdoors air to condition areas, but do so utilizing fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to introduce and disperse cool outdoor air when proper.<p>
