<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Suitable Duct Sealing at Sauk Rapids MN</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, carried out a research study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no considerable improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. In some cases, determined particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Many factors affect IAQ. These aspects include bad ventilation (lack of outside air), problems controlling temperature level, low or high humidity, recent remodeling, and other activities in or near a building that can impact the fresh air entering the structure. Sometimes, specific impurities like dust from building or restoration, mold, cleaning supplies, pesticides, or other air-borne chemicals (consisting of percentages of chemicals released as a gas over time) might cause bad IAQ.<p>
