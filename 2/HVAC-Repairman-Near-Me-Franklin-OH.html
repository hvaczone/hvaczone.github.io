<h3>The History of Air Source Heat Pumps at Franklin OH</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
