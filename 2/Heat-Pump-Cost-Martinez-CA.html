<p>The majority of central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the a/c system.

<p>I am very impressed with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service several years earlier and know the importance of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also amazed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
