<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or lab environments, as opposed to industrial or outdoor settings. In tasks where union membership is not a problem, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC unit, and mounting the ductwork in the building. It might likewise consist of the installation of signs up where the ductwork connects to specific spaces.<p>
<p>A/c unit manufacturers generally make rugged, high quality products. If your air conditioning system stops working, start by examining any fuses or breaker. Let the unit cool off for about 5 minutes before resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioning conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limitation switch might have tripped; reset it by pressing the button, located in the compressor's access panel.<p>
