<p>While these steps will assist to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that just an experienced HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a sluggish refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause expensive compressor failure, but a homeowner does not have the skills or tools needed to check refrigerant levels.
