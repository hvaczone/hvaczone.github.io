<h3>Is The Furnace Running Top Efficiency in Auburn IN?</h3>
<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wooden floor joist system, beneath the wooded subsurface and final floor finish. This is typically utilized in a second or third-floor  location and benefits from the flooring joist cavities while preventing the cost, weight and extra density of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber radiant floor heat hydronic system efficient, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are set up under the pipelines to direct heat up.<p>

If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
