<p>I generally don't leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You do not expect having to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my choices. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss options. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
