<p>Air contaminants can vary from contaminants generated from the outdoors by your family pets to hazardous gas leakages. Carbon monoxide is a common air contaminant resulting from gas that escapes into your house without being burned off. Older houses may include asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when launched into the air. In bathrooms and kitchen areas, mold and mildew can end up being a nuisance where wetness levels are usually higher than in the rest of your house.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) might not be the most pernicious element impacting indoor air quality, however it is typically used as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more occupants there are in a space or building, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from rising expensive-- which can have an unfavorable impact on residents-- outdoors air must be deliberately brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
