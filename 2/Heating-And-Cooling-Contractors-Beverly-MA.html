<p>You might decide to keep your service and product line simple for now if you're in the very first couple of years of business.

<p>In a packaged central air conditioner, the condenser, evaporator, and compressor are all located in one cabinet, which normally is put on a roof or on a concrete piece next to your home's structure. This kind of a/c also is used in small commercial structures. Air supply and return ducts come from indoors through the home's outside wall or roof to get in touch with the packaged air conditioning system, which is generally located outdoors. Packaged air conditioners often consist of electric heating coils or a natural gas furnace. This mix of air conditioner and central heater gets rid of the requirement for a separate furnace inside.<p>
<p>The majority of central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning system works but your home doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
