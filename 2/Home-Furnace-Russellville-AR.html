<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it soaks up heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. While doing so, heat is absorbed from indoors and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of pollutant sources is frequently crucial to figuring out the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such information can in some cases be gotten by asking for copies of air tracking data from the employer. If monitoring information is not readily available, yet a high variety of health signs have actually been reported, the Union representative must request that the company have air monitoring tests conducted. Review of this data might determine possibly dangerous sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. However, when pollutant concentrations are really low, keeping track of information might not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
