<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs silently and effectively, but to have two significant parts fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability.

<p>All heating unit have some level of air filtration. From one of the most fundamental, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter often in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all need some standard maintenance. These filters help with indoor air quality by trapping airborne contaminants flowing through your system. They can also keep your system performing well by helping in reducing the buildup of dust, dirt and other particles from collecting on internal components like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>

<p>There is no simple response, however many use the rule of thumb that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, changing is probably a better solution. If the current system has not sustained other major repairs, remains in otherwise excellent condition, and concerns that led to the breakdown can be identified and fixed, repairing the system can make a great deal of sense as well.<p>
