<h3>Get Your HVAC System Serviced Annually in Broadway VA</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, sending the absorbed heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating unit.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical mix used in autos in the U.S. until 1994, when most styles altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be acquired and used by licensed HVAC service technicians. For systems needing only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and carrying out far much better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "cheap" by many individuals.<p>
