Depending on the type of system set up, it can be noisy and cause problems if you're highly allergic to dust.

Throughout usage, there is a time delay while heat is being transferred from the heating system to the home.<p>
<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was really handy in gathering information on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to briefly manage the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and provided clear interaction about the issue, its treatments, and its future prevention.
