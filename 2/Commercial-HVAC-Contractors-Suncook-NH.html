<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Suitable Duct Sealing at Suncook NH</h3>
<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even small window bundle systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like product, and should be changed or washed as conditions call for. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will need to have the filters altered more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy expenses; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Additionally, very filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
