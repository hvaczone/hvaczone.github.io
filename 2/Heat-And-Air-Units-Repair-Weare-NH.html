<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to offer your house that ideal temperature all year round.

<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your home.

From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is usually routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
