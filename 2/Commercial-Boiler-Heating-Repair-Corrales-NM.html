<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summer. These convection heating systems are still commonly utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
