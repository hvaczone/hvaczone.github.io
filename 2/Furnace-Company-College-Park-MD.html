<p>I typically do not leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my options. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about options. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will advise this company to my pals.<p>
