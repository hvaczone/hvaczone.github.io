<p>Right now, countless dust mites, dead skin cells, building and construction debris, and mold might be living in your home's duct, impacting the air you breathe along with the efficiency of your heating and a/c system. Indoor air quality isn't on most people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a hazard to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a recent survey by the Customer Reports National Proving Ground. But much of the important things individuals do-- or don't do-- can contribute to the stew of air-borne pollutants in their homes and get worse asthma, allergies, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>Not all sensors work the very same way; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're working with an Internet of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality monitoring devices will send the sensing unit information to the cloud, where you can access it via software application. You get immediate, real-time access to the monitoring results by means of a control panel, which turns the information into visual charts that are simple to figure out.<p>

Winter season used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer, with their typically two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to up to 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and individuals." And not just with beginners more accustomed to AC living. Longtime Seattle property owners are lastly giving in, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>

Some employees grumble about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired.
