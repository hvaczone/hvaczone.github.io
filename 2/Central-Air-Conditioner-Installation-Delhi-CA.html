<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pressing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your exposure to this chemical is prudent.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold.

To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to briefly change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
