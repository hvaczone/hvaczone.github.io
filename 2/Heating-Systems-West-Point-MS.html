<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Contractors in West Point</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Today, countless dust mites, dead skin cells, building and construction debris, and mold may be living in your house's air ducts, impacting the air you breathe as well as the efficiency of your heating and air conditioning system.

As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, usually mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
