<p>Indoor air pollution originates from a variety of sources; the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has recognized structure materials, home furnishings, and mold as serious concerns, however much of the danger also originates from burning things. For instance, cigarette smoking or burning wood for heating or cooking can develop pollution in houses that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is an especially huge problem in the developing world.<p>
<p>People working in structures with poor IAQ may observe unpleasant or musty odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your physician about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no replacement for great structure management.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos items consist of vinyl asbestos flooring tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement items. These items present a danger just when they are handled in such a way that produces dust containing asbestos fibers which can be inhaled. When asbestos-containing products are damaged or disrupted by repair, renovating, or demolition activities, tiny fibers can end up being airborne if proper controls are not in location. This can lead to the potential for significant illness.<p>
