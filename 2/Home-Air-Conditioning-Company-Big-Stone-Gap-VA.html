<p>EER represents Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a traditional system of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people don't utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe just as essential when it comes to central air conditioning costs, is the AC system's size. A system that is too big will have a simple time keeping the home cool, however will have a more difficult time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too little will not be able to correctly cool the home on hot days. Thinking about bigger systems cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
