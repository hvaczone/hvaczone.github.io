<p>Airflow patterns in building are figured out by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural impacts. Atmospheric pressure distinctions created by these forces move air-borne toxins from locations of higher pressure to areas of lower pressure through any available opening in building walls, ceilings, floors, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is small, air will move until the within pressure amounts to the outside.<p>
<p>A geothermal heating system is more trustworthy than alternatives, and is not affected by any external elements, unlike other renewable energies such as wind energy and solar power.
