<p>The remainder of the HVAC system likewise needs to be in leading condition for the a/c unit to work well. This includes the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and signs up, all of which reside inside the house. If the private parts remain in correct order, the technician can examine the ductwork for signs of holes, gaps or extreme dirt. Sealing leakages in ductwork can enhance HVAC efficiency by as much as 30 percent, and attend to a cooler house in the hot summertime.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things first. Ensure all the signs up in your house are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The lowered airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous registers were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's good air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the issue.<p>
