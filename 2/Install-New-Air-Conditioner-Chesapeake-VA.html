Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them up until they have actually been correctly dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up.
