Hence, for many people, the threats to health might be higher due to direct exposure to air pollution indoors than outdoors.<p>
<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things initially. Make certain all the registers in the house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2).

Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's excellent airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You have actually solved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
