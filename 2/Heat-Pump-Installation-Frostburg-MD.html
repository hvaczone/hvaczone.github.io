<p>If you set it too low, you're motivating the development of mold in wet air. The heat dries out the air, preventing mold development and pollution. Obviously, too-dry air can also irritate your lungs and sinuses, while too much indoor humidity can add to the growth of bacteria and viruses, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. The perfect humidity in a home is around half, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, eye, and nose and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal research studies that repeated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at particular threat from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and people with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
<p>While toxins typically discovered in indoor air are accountable for many damaging effects, there is significant unpredictability about what concentrations or periods of direct exposure are required to produce specific health problems. Individuals also respond really in a different way to exposure to indoor air toxins. More research is required to much better comprehend which health effects happen after exposure to the typical pollutant concentrations found in homes and which occur from the greater concentrations that occur for brief time periods.<p>
<p>Since my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose spent time repairing the problem, all the while discussing everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working appropriately. He had to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
