<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things first. Make certain all the registers in your house are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The reduced air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous registers were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's excellent air flow at the signs up.
