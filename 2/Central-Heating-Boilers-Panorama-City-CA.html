<p>SysTech Style focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and maintaining the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your home. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
