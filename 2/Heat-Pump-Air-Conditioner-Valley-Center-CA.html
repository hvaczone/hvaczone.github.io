<p>Make certain there are no carpets, furniture, or anything else restricting the circulation of air. Not only will blocked vents and registers affect your comfort, they can likewise result in duct leaks due to excessive air pressure and early HVAC repairs and breakdowns.

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide ought to be calibrated regularly, and outside measurements utilized for estimations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors might also be needed.<p>

The quality of indoor air will be impacted if one or more of these procedures are underperforming.<p>
