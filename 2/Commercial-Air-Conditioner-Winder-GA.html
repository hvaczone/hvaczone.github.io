Secondly, if you prepare to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, specifically concrete in basements, make certain that an efficient wetness barrier is installed prior to installing the carpet. If it ends up being damp, do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be removed.<p>

When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact eliminate countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
