<p>I have actually been using them for many years for my organisations, my own houses and my real estate clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with different prices and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who explained to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. He assisted me problem shoot the issue when I called and he encouraged me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working again. He is sincere, trusted, and reasonable on rate. It's tough to find a truthful AC man and I'm happy I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
<p>5. Smell good naturally.

After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
