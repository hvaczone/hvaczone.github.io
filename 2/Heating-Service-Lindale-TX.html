<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pushing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up, do decline them until they have actually been effectively dried. Attempt a various dry cleaner if products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent gos to.<p>
