<h3>The Function of the Boiler Burner at Alfred ME</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to eliminate the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heater. We picked getting something more costly than a standard hot water heater as gas is among our most significant energy expenses. We feel that this new unit will last a very long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
