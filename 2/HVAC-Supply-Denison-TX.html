<p>All houses need efficient ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has been stressed out from use. Another possible reason might be a broken thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adjusting to the correct temperature. Heaters that kick on regularly may be because of a dirty filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal issue. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps an unclean burner.<p>

When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the flooring, and into the room. This is why the method is described as radiant heating.<p>
