<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Unclean filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your home will not warm up. Change the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. An unclean filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, decreasing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<h3>Heat Ventilation And Air Conditioning in Spicewood TX 78669</h3>
<p>While radon in water is not a problem in homes served by most public water products, it has actually been found in well water. If you've tested the air in your house and discovered a radon problem, and you have a well, get in touch with a laboratory accredited to determine radiation in water to have your water checked. Radon issues in water can be easily repaired. Call your state radon office or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for additional information.<p>
<p>Though it may be hard to think, the air inside your home can be even worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are well-known for reducing the air quality in your house, however there are many other contaminants that can not just dirty up the air, but cause other health complications. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning supplies and building products add to bad air quality, and can likewise cause cancers. VOCs (unstable natural substances) from paint and even from some type of carpeting and upholstery products can trigger problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be offenders, too.<p>
<p>Air contaminants can vary from pollutants brought in from the outdoors by your family pets to dangerous gas leakages. Carbon monoxide gas is a typical air toxin resulting from natural gas that escapes into your house without being burned off. Older homes might include asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when launched into the air. In restrooms and kitchens, mold and mildew can end up being a nuisance where wetness levels are generally greater than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioning conditioner, you may choose to change the outside compressor with a modern, high-efficiency system. Seek advice from a local heating and cooling contractor to ensure that the brand-new compressor is properly matched to the indoor unit if you do so. However, considering current changes in refrigerants and air conditioning designs, it may be wiser to replace the entire system.<p>
