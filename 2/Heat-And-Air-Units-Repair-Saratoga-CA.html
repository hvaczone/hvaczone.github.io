<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what materials 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer malfunctions, your Nest won't come on. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that secure your a/c system from flooding. Among the most typical places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is revealing a blank screen, it is a good chance; you may have a water leak in the attic. The water triggers your emergency safety switch, therefore cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This deactivates all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have seen baseplate go bad on rare occasions.<p>
