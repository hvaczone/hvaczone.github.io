<h3>Heating And Cooling Contractors in Oakwood GA 30566</h3>
<p>We got in touch with Elite A/C on one of the most popular days of summer( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out exact same day to examine circumstance & chose to opt for them for the work.

<p>Cooling can also be provided by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, consequently decreasing its efficiency.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is absorbed from inside and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
