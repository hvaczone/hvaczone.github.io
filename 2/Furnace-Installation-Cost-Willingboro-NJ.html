<p>I generally don't leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my options. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about options. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>
