<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were very delighted that somebody as knowledgeable as Adam had the ability to return and repair the air conditioner. We had actually purchased the club member maintenance plan, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to check the ac system before you purchase. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam stated he had ways to check AC units even in winter. We wish we had understood him then.<p>
<p>Don't worry! Your Nest thermostat is still ok; it simply may need 24 volts of electrical power. The Nest thermostat needs 24 volts of low voltage provided by your transformer to keep the digital screen on. You'll get a blank screen if 24 volts isn't obtained. There are several reasons that your Nest appears dead or has a blank screen. We'll be talking about why you may be having difficulty with your Nest clever thermostat. Examine your emergency breakers initially. You should have the correct amount of high voltage going to your furnace. Inspect if you have the proper 120 volts of power going to the furnace.
