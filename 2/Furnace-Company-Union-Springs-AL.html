<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the automobile debit, although my company does not offer auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of money being available in each month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to offer car debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There ought to not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
