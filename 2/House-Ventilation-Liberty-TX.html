<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to provide your home that ideal temperature level throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining a few of those typical air contaminants. Eventually, their air filters fill and stop doing their task. Not only does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can lead to pricey repairs down the roadway. So, be sure to change your AC filters routinely, or get a cooling service plan which typically includes a filter change - especially if you are allergy-prone or reside in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is usually routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
