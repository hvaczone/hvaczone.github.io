<h3>Average HVAC Services Offered by a Union MO HVAC Company</h3>
<p>All modern cooling systems, even small window bundle systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like product, and need to be replaced or washed as conditions warrant.

Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. In addition, very unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
