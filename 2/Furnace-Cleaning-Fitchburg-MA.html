I am happy to state that not just did we get the central air conditioning going but likewise replaced the heating system which was old. Everybody we talked to from beginning to end were very professional, polite and the work was very effectively done. I would highly recommend this company.<p>
<p>These people have been fantastic. At a real estate agent, I sometimes need contractors to give me an opinion for what deal with a house may cost. Recently I needed to call on these guys twice.

Integrity isn't just their name, it's a business model they take seriously. You people are formally on speed dial. Talk with you quickly.<p>

Meanwhile, in huge box stores like Best Buy, package fans and window AC units are nabbed up as soon as they're stacked in floor screens. Seattle may be the last city in the nation to face the reality of a terrible, vicious summer.<p>
