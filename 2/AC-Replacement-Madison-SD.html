<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>With the cost of electricity and gas increasing, it is necessary to have your furnace tuned-up for optimum energy cost savings. This will keep you from unnecessarily paying more than you should.

<p>Call in an expert each year prior to winter hits to guarantee your heating and cooling components are running efficiently. It is also important to keep in mind that air contaminants are universal and tend to have deep-rooted sources in the house's ventilation system. Asking a technician to extensive clean or replace parts that host irritants such as dust, mold, mildew, and germs can improve your health which of your household.<p>
