<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
