According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are frequently 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outdoor levels of the very same contaminants. To put it simply, in some cases the air inside can be more harmful than the air outside.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and impurity concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that enables the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system elements, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in large residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>

If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
