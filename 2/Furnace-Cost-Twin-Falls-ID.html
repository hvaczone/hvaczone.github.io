However, a lot of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
