<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise because 1978. If your air conditioning unit is low on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. Merely including refrigerant is not a service if it leaks. A qualified technician needs to fix any leakage, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the right quantity of refrigerant.
