<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you would not provide them.  Secondly like prolonged vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the required skills to do the task and also the morals to treat customers relatively. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be totally taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to properly service and the system has actually been running issue complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<h3>Air Condition Service in White Cloud MI 49349</h3>
<p>I have actually been utilizing them for several years for my services, my own houses and my real estate clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with various rates and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who discussed to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another occasion. He helped me trouble shoot the issue when I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working once again. He is truthful, reputable, and sensible on rate. It's tough to find a truthful AC guy and I'm grateful I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
<p>G&S did an exceptional task installing our new furnace and AC system. The best thing about G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Makers service warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their warranty. Also they detected the issue and repaired extremely quickly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Central air is a high-end not everybody can afford, many Seattleites need to find ways to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. On the other hand, in big box shops like Best Buy, package fans and window AC systems are nabbed up as soon as they're stacked in floor display screens. Seattle might be the last city in the country to face the truth of a terrible, cruel summer season.<p>
<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Purchased a brand-new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase extended service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>
