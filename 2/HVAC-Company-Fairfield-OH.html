<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs silently and efficiently, but to have 2 significant elements fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the billing before work started. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>In a location where temperature levels reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make great primary heating unit.
