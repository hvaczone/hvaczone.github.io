<h3>Central Air Conditioning Repair in Redmond OR 97756</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner".

When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise switches functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
