<p>Recently, Target informed reporters at The Wall Street Journal and Reuters that the initial intrusion into its systems was traced back to network credentials that were stolen from a third party vendor. Sources now inform KrebsOnSecurity that the supplier in concern was an air, refrigeration and heating  conditioning subcontractor that has actually operated at a variety of locations at Target and other top sellers.<p>
<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, know that there are maintenance items that only a trained HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can result in expensive compressor failure, but a homeowner does not have the skills or tools required to inspect refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and proper air flow are important to a well-functioning system, however house owners lack the required devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy house owner, it's still needed to have a professional technician inspect the system periodically.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air problems by adding new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes give off contaminants.) However, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
