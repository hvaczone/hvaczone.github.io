<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you need to look out for. First, you must check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
