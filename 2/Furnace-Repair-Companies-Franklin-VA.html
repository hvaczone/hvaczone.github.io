<p>The impacts of lead exposure on fetuses and children can be extreme. They consist of delays in psychological and physical development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention periods, and increased behavioral problems. Babies, children, and fetuses are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than adults since lead is more easily soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more sensitive to the damaging results of lead. Children may have greater direct exposures because they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>
