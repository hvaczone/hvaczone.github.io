<h3>Furnace Maintenance  in Cleveland OK 74020</h3>
<p>I generally don't leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You don't expect having to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my options. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about options. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will advise this company to my pals.<p>
<p>Advanced ventilation systems that enable greater airflow from the outdoors, air quality monitoring platforms and sensors, and new air filtration technologies are ending up being more common as readily available options in residential and commercial HVAC product packages. Adoption of these technologies, however, has not been extensive, as clients stay largely oblivious to the results of air quality on health and efficiency.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are often more challenging to control than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity needs to be kept at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to minimize mold development.<p>
<p>Moist and humid conditions breed mold and mildew that can activate respiratory concerns like allergies and asthma. Depending upon your location, the hot summer months can produce especially humid conditions. Reduce the quantity of moisture in the air and curb the growth of annoying molds with a couple of well-placed dehumidifiers. There are a range of humidifier alternatives that will assist preserve constant humidity levels and produce comfortable living conditions in your house.<p>
