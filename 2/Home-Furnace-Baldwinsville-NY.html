<p>I am extremely satisfied with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call company several years ago and know the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also pleased that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high sufficient temperature level, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be warmed without being available in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct work, providing warm air to individual bedrooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
