<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
