<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
