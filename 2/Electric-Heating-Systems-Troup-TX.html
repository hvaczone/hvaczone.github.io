<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not use automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of money coming in on a monthly basis, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer automobile debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There ought to not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
