(If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI protected.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
