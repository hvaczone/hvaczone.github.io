<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture, Air cleaning happens. The goal is to provide sufficient modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to accomplish this. A common component necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
