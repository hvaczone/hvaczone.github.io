<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems in houses. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating enough outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air contaminants out of the house. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odor free, radioactive gas. Radon gas enters houses through dirt floorings, fractures in concrete walls and floors, floor drains, and sumps. When radon becomes trapped in concentrations and buildings build up inside, direct exposure to radon ends up being an issue.<p>

Asbestos can trigger lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and stomach linings), and asbestosis (irreparable lung scarring that can be fatal). Symptoms of these diseases do not show up until several years after direct exposure started. The majority of people with asbestos-related illness were exposed to elevated concentrations on the job; some industrialized disease from direct exposure to clothing and devices brought house from task sites.<p>
