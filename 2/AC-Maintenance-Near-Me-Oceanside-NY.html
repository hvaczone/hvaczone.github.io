Permeable products, flooring, wall, and ceiling coverings, and furnishings discovered in the basements that have actually been wet for over 24 to 48 hours may end up being a source for mold growth and should be disposed of. Often there is a moldy smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can thrive in concealed or rarely accessed areas of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic.
