<p>An undersize unit will not have the ability to cool rooms down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate because it needs to run longer than a properly sized system. Due to the fact that it merely takes more electrical power to run a bigger unit, an oversize compressor likewise costs more to operate. And an oversize system does not lower humidity successfully. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down prior to it has a chance to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the needed wetness. The outcome is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In truth, the space can feel wet and clammy.<p>
