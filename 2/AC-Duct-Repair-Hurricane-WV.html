<h3>What to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service at Hurricane WV</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odor-free gas that disrupts the delivery of oxygen throughout the body. At high concentrations it can trigger unconsciousness and death. Lower concentrations can cause a variety of signs from headaches, d izziness, weakness, queasiness, confusion, and disorientation, to fatigue in healthy people and episodes of increased chest discomfort in people with chronic cardiovascular disease. The symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning are in some cases confused with the flu or food poisoning. Fetuses, babies, elderly people, and individuals with anemia or with a history of heart or breathing illness can be particularly sensitive to carbon monoxide exposures.<p>
