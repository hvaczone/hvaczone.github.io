<p>Sean was really valuable. He is a very pleasant person to work with. No pressure used to buy extra things. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no problems other than the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
