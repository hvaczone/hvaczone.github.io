<h3>Heat Pump Water Heater in Winston GA 30187</h3>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
