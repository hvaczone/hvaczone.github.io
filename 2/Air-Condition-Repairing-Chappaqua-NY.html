Connection concerns along the line that supplies power to your furnace can jeopardize the efficiency of the system. Loose, missing or malfunctioning wires will cause the thermostat to lose its connection to the unit and interrupt service. Part of maintaining your furnace includes checking the suggested connections in addition to temperature and pressure evaluates.
