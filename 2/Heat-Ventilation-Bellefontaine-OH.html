For a long time I dismissed him but then I understood that it actually didnâ $ t disperse air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really think about anything else other than changing it. The one I got deserves every penny.

<p>Biological impurities consist of germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transmitted by animals and individuals; bacteria are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. It can become air-borne when it dries. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these pollutants through the house.<p>
