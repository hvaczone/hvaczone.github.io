<p>Co2 (CO2) may not be the most pernicious element impacting indoor air quality, but it is often used as a surrogate for air quality and building tenancy level. The more residents there are in a room or structure, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from increasing too expensive-- which can have a negative impact on residents-- outside air must be intentionally brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
