<p>Specific instant results resemble those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is frequently tough to determine if the symptoms are a result of exposure to indoor air contamination. For this factor, it is essential to pay attention to the time and place the symptoms take place. If the symptoms fade or disappear when a person is away from the house and return when the individual returns, an effort needs to be made to identify indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some impacts might be worsened by an insufficient supply of outside air or from the cooling, humidity, or heating conditions widespread in the home.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have very high effectiveness, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summertime a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>As a structure owner or facility supervisor, you need to think about the cost of unanticipated downtime and the impact older, inefficient systems have on the bottom line.
