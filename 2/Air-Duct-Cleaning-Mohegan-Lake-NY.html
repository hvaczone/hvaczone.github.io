<p>A bioaerosol is an air-borne item of a biological impurity. Biological contaminants in the house may consist of mold, germs, viruses, mites, and pollen. Bioaerosols launched into the air can be dispersed throughout the house by the HVAC system. Bioaerosols can cause infectious diseases such as Legionnaires' illness.

<p>Some health results might show up quickly after a single direct exposure or duplicated exposures to a toxin. These include inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Such immediate effects are treatable and generally short-term. In some cases the treatment is just removing the individual's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be determined.
