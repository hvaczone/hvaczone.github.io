<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help identify the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness, Air cleaning happens. The goal is to offer sufficient modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical aspect necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
