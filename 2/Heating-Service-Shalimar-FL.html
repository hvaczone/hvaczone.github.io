<p>The federal government advises that homes be weatherized in order to minimize the quantity of energy required for heating & cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, actions need to likewise be required to minimize contamination from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for advised actions.) In addition, residents must look out to the emergence of indications of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, wetness condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew development. Extra weatherization procedures must not be carried out till these issues have been remedied.<p>
<p>While these steps will assist to keep your AC system in leading shape, know that there are maintenance products that only a qualified HVAC technician will be able to do.
