Asbestos can cause lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and abdominal linings), and asbestosis (permanent lung scarring that can be fatal).

<p>Everybody face a variety of threats to our health as we go about our daily lives. Driving in cars, flying in planes, engaging in leisure activities, and being exposed to environmental pollutants all pose differing degrees of danger. Some dangers are just inevitable.

<p>We take a look at ideas prior to we offer suggestions to replace instead of repair a heating unit. One of the hints we look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to use, or if energy costs are greater every year, we know the unit is not running effectively. It may be in ideal condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more effective model, then you would be wasting money by not replacing the older system.<p>
