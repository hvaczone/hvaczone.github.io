If your furnace remains in an extremely poor condition, possibly it is time to start thinking about purchasing a new one.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the price fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my home to make the total air flow more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
