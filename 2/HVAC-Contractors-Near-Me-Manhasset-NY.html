Pushed wood items made for indoor usage consist of: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in kitchen cabinetry and furnishings); hardwood plywood paneling (used for decorative wall covering and used in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiber board (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furnishings tops).
