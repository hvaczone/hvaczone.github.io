<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either since of noticeable growth or a moldy smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not eliminate the mold.

Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Again, if you believe a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
