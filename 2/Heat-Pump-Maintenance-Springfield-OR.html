<p>5. Smell good naturally. You might associate that lemony or piney aroma with a tidy kitchen area or clean artificial fragrances in laundry items and air fresheners discharge dozens of different chemicals into the air. You will not find their names on the item labels. Standard laundry cleaning agents, material softeners, anti-static sheet, and air fresheners in strong, spray, and oil form might all release such gasses.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more challenging to manage than they seem due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity needs to be maintained at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to minimize mold growth.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in adequate outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the area. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
