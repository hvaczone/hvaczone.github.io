<p>I was extremely delighted in the beginning since things ran efficiently without any sound. Furthermore, I saw obvious modifications in my electrical energy costs.

Dependable on the whole. Neat operation and very good cooling system. Yes, I was not happy with its looks in the beginning. But then recognized Air conditionings are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
