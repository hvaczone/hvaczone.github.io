<h3>Air Conditioning And Heating Companies in Mabelvale AR 72103</h3>
<p>There are two main kinds of radiant flooring heating, or RFH as it's known in the home heating company. One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then circulated through a piping system under the flooring surface area. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the floor are forced to resist current, which then generates heat.<p>
<p>Cooling can also be provided by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>
