<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may need a recommendation in the future). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually swapped all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
