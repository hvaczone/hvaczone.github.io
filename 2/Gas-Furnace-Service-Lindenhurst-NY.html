<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. On the day of the appointment he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he spent educating me about our system, and left having fixed the problem with an easy repair he did on-site, not replacing the whole part. He was friendly, straightforward and a thoroughly enjoyable individual to have around that whole time. His time and competence to SOLVE the problem cost us less than what we paid the other company just to do a somewhat unsure diagnostic.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the price great but Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my home to make the overall air flow more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
