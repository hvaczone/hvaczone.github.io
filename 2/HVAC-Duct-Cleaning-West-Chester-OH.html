<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned up frequently, they can become blocked with particles that can limit airflow, possibly impacting your convenience and your system's effectiveness. Filthy filters can trigger extra wear and tear on furnace components and in more extreme cases trigger the system to shut down totally. By comparison, inspecting and replacing a furnace filter can usually be carried out in simply a few minutes, often with no tools required. As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, usually mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

<h3>Working of a HVAC System in West Chester OH</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
