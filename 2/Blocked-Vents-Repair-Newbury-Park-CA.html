<p>I normally do not leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my choices. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family pal and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>
