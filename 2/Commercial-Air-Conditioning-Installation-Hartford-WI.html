<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not provide car debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money being available in each month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to offer auto debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There must not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>
