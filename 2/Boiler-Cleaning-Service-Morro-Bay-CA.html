<p>Radiant heat uses a variety of unique advantages over forced air heater. For instance, radiant heat systems are more energy effective than forced air systems. They don't have to fret about duct leakages, which are accountable for output losses of up to 30% in other heating system types. Transferring heat through strong objects will also cause it to last longer than using air as a thermal medium. A home warmed by a glowing system will heat up faster, and remain warm with less energy spent. These are simply a few of the many benefits that a radiant heat system can offer you.<p>

Radiant heat systems can also heat rooms with less energy invested, and keep them heated up for longer, considering that the majority of floorings tend to keep heat much better than air does.<p>
