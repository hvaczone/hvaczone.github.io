<p>When setting up the whole system, geothermal heat pump cost is far more than other heat pump types. Geothermal systems need underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy. Installing one involved excavation, running numerous yards of piping, burying the loop, and more. This procedure is rather costly. Setting up a new geothermal heatpump to deal with an existing ground loop is far cheaper.<p>
<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to change your filters routinely, they're not kidding. It's as essential as a routine oil change in your vehicle. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps impurities and particles in the air. When every three months, Energy Star advises changing your filter. Throughout high use months, examine the filters at least month-to-month.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture. The goal is to supply adequate changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical aspect essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
