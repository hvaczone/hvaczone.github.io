<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Radiant heat systems have been around since the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipes under their marble floorings and tied them into a warm water supply. Romans utilized a wood-fired boiler tended by servants and a primary pumping maker to circulate warm water that warmed their stone floors. In turn, the uniformity of the floor heat transferred heat to other posts in the rooms, including the human occupants.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat increases, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the warmth naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head area.
