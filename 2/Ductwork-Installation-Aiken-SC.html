<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here).

<p>When mounting a wall sensing unit, consider the height at which they must be put.

For instance, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air and so the greatest concentrations inside structures are generally near the ceiling. Conversely, ozone is heavier than air and stays near the floor.<p>
