<p>Factors that can add to the development of biological impurities are wet or damp building materials (carpeting, ceilings, walls) and improperly kept humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioning system. "Humidifier fever" is a typical illness brought on by incorrect maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs.

If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
