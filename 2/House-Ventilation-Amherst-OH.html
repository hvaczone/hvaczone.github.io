<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one limitation: their overall power ought to not surpass the capacity of the outdoor system.

However, it is wrong to expect better performance when all indoor systems are turned on at the very same time, because the total capacity of the entire system is restricted by the capability of the outside unit. Basically, the outdoor system will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a method that some of the rooms might not have a really comfortable temperature level. However, the computation of the total power is not easy, since it takes into consideration not only the small power of the systems, however also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>

PTAC systems might be adapted to offer heating in winter, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioning system into a heat pump While space cooling offers maximum flexibility, when used to cool numerous spaces at a time it is typically more costly than central air.<p>
