What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over alternatives. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
