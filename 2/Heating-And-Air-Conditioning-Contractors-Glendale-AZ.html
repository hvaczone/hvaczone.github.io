<h3>The History of Air Source Heat Pumps at Glendale AZ</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the whole day as they required to get rid of the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heating system. We chose getting something more pricey than a traditional water heater as gas is one of our biggest energy expenses. We feel that this new unit will last a very long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a hose pipe twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your home. Now the "difficult part" once a year shut down the electrical power open the furnace and very thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the elements, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
