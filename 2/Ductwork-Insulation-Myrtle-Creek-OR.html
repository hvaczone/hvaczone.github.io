<p>If your air conditioning system is more than eight years of ages, repair is probably not worth the cost, unless it's a basic problem like particles clogging the condenser unit or a worn fan belt. Still, to finest weigh your repair-or-replace choice, ask your contractor to evaluate not just the condition of your existing devices, however likewise the ducts that provide the cool air and the overall quality of the insulation in your house.

<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
