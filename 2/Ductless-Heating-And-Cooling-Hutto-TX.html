<p>How climate change affects air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for contemporary air conditioning unit) needs that the rate of energy removal by the ac system increase. This boost has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
