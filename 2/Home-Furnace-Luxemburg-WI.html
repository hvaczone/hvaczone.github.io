<p>Indoor environments are extremely intricate and structure residents might be exposed to a variety of contaminants (in the type of gases and particles) from workplace makers, cleaning products, construction furnishings, activities and carpets, fragrances, cigarette smoke, water-damaged structure materials, microbial development (fungal, mold, and bacterial), insects, and outdoor contaminants.

The more occupants there are in a space or building, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from increasing too high-- which can have an unfavorable influence on residents-- outside air needs to be intentionally brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
