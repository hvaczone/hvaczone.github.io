<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not offer automobile debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of money coming in on a monthly basis, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use auto debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There ought to not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
