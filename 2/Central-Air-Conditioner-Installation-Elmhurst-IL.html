Since they only partly get rid of the radon decay items and do not reduce the quantity of radon entering the home, the effectiveness of these devices is unpredictable.

EPA's pamphlet, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, provides additional info on air-cleaning gadgets to lower indoor air pollutants.<p>

Likewise, tidy ducts and correct airflow are vital to a well-functioning system, but homeowners do not have the essential devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy homeowner, it's still required to have a specialist technician check the system occasionally.<p>
