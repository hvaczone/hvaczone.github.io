<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Basics in Riverside CT</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were very delighted that somebody as skilled as Adam had the ability to return and fix the air conditioner. We had bought the club member maintenance strategy, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.)

We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam stated he had ways to check AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had actually known him then.<p>

<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have concerns, they give me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not need.<p>
