He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call company several years earlier and know the importance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also pleased that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>After the system has been looked for leaks, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside need to be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>
