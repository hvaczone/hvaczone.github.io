<h3>Determining Heat Pump Efficiency in Locust Grove VA</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to get rid of the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heating unit. We chose getting something more expensive than a conventional water heater as gas is among our biggest energy expenditures. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He knew simply what the problem was and repaired it very rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
