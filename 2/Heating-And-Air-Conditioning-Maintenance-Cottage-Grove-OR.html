Till 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER.

<p>Selecting the best size central air system for your house is very important, as is choosing either a package system, which keeps condenser, fan and coil all in one system, or a split system, which positions the condenser outside the house and the fan and coil inside.
