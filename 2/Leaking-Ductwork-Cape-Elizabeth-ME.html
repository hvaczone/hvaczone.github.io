<p>These people have actually been excellent. At a realtor, I in some cases require contractors to offer me a viewpoint for what work on a home might cost. Recently I required to call on these men two times. They came out rapidly and provided me a no nonsense estimate for the work.

Integrity isn't just their name, it's an organisation model they take seriously. You guys are officially on speed dial. Talk with you quickly.<p>
<p>Central air is a high-end not everybody can pay for, many Seattleites need to find ways to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. Meanwhile, in big box shops like Best Buy, the box fans and window AC systems are snatched up as quickly as they're stacked in floor screens. Seattle may be the last city in the nation to deal with the truth of a harsh, cruel summer.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
