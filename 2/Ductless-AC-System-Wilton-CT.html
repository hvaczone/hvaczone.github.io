The EPA study recommended and managed approaches utilized on a smaller variety of homes.

<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the ac system works but your house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>

The perfect humidity in a house is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>This is especially significant, as gas stoves can trigger levels of pollution that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with inadequately adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher.

When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
