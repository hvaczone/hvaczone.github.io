<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act much like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system. If your house or structure has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most cost effective. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to set up a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations.

Individuals at specific risk from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and individuals with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
