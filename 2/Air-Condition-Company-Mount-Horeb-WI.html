<p>How environment change affects air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for modern-day ac system) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning system increase. This increase has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c should increase its power usage by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the a/c has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The ac system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are typically referred to as simply radiant systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating aspects installed in the subfloor of each space in the house, periodically connected to terminal systems like baseboard heating systems. When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the floor, and into the room. This is why the method is referred to as radiant heating.<p>

Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire.
