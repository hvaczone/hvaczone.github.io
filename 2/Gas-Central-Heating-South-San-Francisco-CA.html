<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance in South San Francisco CA</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the whole day as they required to eliminate the old hot water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heater. We picked getting something more costly than a standard hot water heater as gas is among our biggest energy costs. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and usage extremely little energy to heat water.<p>

Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
