<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the cost fantastic but Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air flow more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
