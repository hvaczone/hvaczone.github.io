<p>Specialist heating unit installations. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heating unit will eventually fail. HVAC professionals advise following this standard rule when deciding whether it deserves purchasing a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost more than half the cost of a brand-new system, it's finest to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have a lot more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than needed.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not use car debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash can be found in monthly, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer auto debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>
