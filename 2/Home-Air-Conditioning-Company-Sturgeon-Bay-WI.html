<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, but furnace specialists often find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Search for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

<p>Many central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning unit works but your house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>
