<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered force in 2000 and banned the use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation prohibited using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that devices that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture, Air cleaning occurs. The goal is to supply enough changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this. A typical aspect essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
