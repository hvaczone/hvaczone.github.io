We had bought the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any homebuyers: employ Blue Flame to test the air conditioning system prior to you purchase. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam said he had methods to test AC systems even in winter. We wish we had actually understood him then.<p>
