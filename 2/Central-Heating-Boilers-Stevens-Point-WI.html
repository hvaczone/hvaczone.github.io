<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine components. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs dealt with by specialists, see Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair today.<p>
