However, you'll conserve money over the long term due to the fact that of the lower energy costs. Also, a geothermal system tends to last about two times as long as traditional air-source units. The lack of moving parts implies you're less most likely to spend huge on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be expected to last for 50 years. They're significantly more efficient then even the highest-efficiency air source systems.<p>
