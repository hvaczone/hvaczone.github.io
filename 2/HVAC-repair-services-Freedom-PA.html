Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up many years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
