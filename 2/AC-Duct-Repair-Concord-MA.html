<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn On Your Air Conditioner at Concord MA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was fast and extremely clear about his assessment, guaranteeing I understood what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is generally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
