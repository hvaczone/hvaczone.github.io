<h3>How Does a Heat Pump Work in Waynesboro PA?</h3>
<p>Dunes Heating And Cooling is HVAC Contractor providing the best possible Heating and A/c Repair, maintenance and installation for your house or service in Mount Pleasant, Charleston and Isle of Palms South Carolina.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
