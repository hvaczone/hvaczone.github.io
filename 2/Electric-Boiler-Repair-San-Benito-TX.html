<h3>Heating Duct in San Benito Texas</h3>
<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either because of visible growth or a moldy odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and preserve. Dripping return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you suspect a mold issue, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>

If that holds true with your home, a ductless heat pump may be the ideal suitable for you, given that it requires less electrical service, or for a central air unit, brand-new electrical service can often be added. Your AC installer will know what to search for.<p>
