<p>In addition, employee health signs such as colds, headaches, sleepiness, inflammation, and irregular breathing might be caused as the result of temperature level extremes, improper humidity levels, and too much or too little air circulation. Work environment temperatures need to be preserved between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels in between 30%- 60%. In addition, drafts caused by too much air blood circulation should be prevented.<p>
<p>If your single phase a/c isn't old sufficient to justify replacement, consider a whole home dehumidifier. By installing dehumidification equipment inside an existing single stage system, you can enjoy a few of the advantages of a variable speed compressor without replacing any equipment. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfy level, improving indoor air quality and allowing higher convenience at higher temperatures.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you might select to change the outdoor compressor with a contemporary, high-efficiency unit. If you do so, speak with a local heating and cooling contractor to ensure that the brand-new compressor is effectively matched to the indoor unit. However, thinking about recent modifications in refrigerants and a/c styles, it may be smarter to change the whole system.<p>
