<p>Since it's the most typical heating system in Seattle houses, I'll start with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your home through ducts, and cool air is gathered by means of cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are rated for effectiveness. Older units from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is wasted throughout the combustion procedure. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your house already has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a relatively uncomplicated process. Installing a new gas furnace system can be rather expensive if you are including on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>
