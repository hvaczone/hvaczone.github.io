As an initial step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set stronger indoor standards based on the most current science for NO2.

<p>The pollutants noted in this guide have actually been revealed to trigger the health results mentioned. However, it is not necessarily real that the effects noted occur at the pollutant concentration levels generally found in the house.
