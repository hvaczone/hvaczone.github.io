As an initial step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set stronger indoor standards based on the most current science for NO2.

<p>The pollutants noted in this guide have actually been revealed to trigger the health results mentioned. However, it is not necessarily real that the effects noted occur at the pollutant concentration levels generally found in the house. In a lot of cases, our understanding of the pollutants and their health results is too limited to identify the levels at which the listed impacts could take place.<p>
<p>That said, when you talk these aspects over with Seattle HVAC professionals, different companies might regularly recommend different services.
