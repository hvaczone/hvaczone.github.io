The perfect humidity in a house is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>EER represents Energy Performance Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air systems is determined by the variety of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people don't utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Heating is also one of the greatest energy customers in your home, so house owners who might be looking for a new furnace should thinking about changing it with a more recent, more energy-efficient design to conserve money and assist the environment.
