<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, performed a study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by enhancing air flow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy effectiveness.
