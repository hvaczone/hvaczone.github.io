When you opt for Service HQ's duct cleaning services, you will not have to fret about a thing.<p>

That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get a couple of maintenance check outs per year, plus another service call, a discount on parts, and typically some other perks. Some companies offer top priority consultations to their maintenance plan members.<p>
