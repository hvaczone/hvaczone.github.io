<p>RMI is working to change that, beginning in California. As a first step, in April RMI affirmed prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set more powerful indoor standards based upon the most current science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to regulate indoor home appliances through codes, and after stronger standards are set there is an opportunity to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine carbon dioxide must be adjusted often, and outside measurements used for estimations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors may also be essential.<p>
<p>If you think there is a health concern related to the indoor environment, please schedule an appointment for a medical assessment at the University Employee Occupational Health Clinic by calling 919-966-9119. At this time, you will be asked to complete the Ask for Indoor Air Quality Investigation kind (discovered in the Indoor Air Quality Policy). Please complete the kind and submit by means of e-mail or fax It is necessary when finishing the request that you provide as much information as possible for the EHS Responder.<p>
