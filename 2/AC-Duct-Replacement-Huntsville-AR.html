<p>Prior to you head out and buy an a/c unit, there are a few things to decide initially. Where are you going to be installing the air conditioning unit? If your house is not outfitted with ductwork, do you wish to install some or go ductless? How large should the air conditioning unit be? Too large and you'll encounter issues with short-cycling, which can damage the ac system and shorten its life. Too small and your a/c won't have the ability to cool your home effectively. When going shopping for a brand-new AC system, these are just a few of the factors that you need to take into account.

This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
