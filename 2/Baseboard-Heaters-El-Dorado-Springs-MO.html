<p>Recent Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time.

<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in heaps. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 load system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 heap unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it indicates the amount of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area.

Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its effectiveness.<p>
