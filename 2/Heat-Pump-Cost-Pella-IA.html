<p>We're Not Simply Another Air Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Building-Related Disease (BRI) describes less regular (however frequently more severe) cases of people ending up being ill after being in a particular building at a particular time.

Legionnaires Disease is an example of BRI brought on by germs which can pollute a building's cooling system.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outdoor unit as close to your home as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
<h3>AC Maintenance Near Me in Pella Iowa</h3>
<p>If you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz, you're most likely hearing the fan motor attempting to begin without the increase it needs from the capacitor. You can almost always conclude that the capacitor has actually failed. In some cases you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pushing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. But the chances are good that this might work for one cycle, but the capacitor will fail next time the AC goes on. It's best to replace the capacitor.<p>

<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

<p>I have actually been using them for several years for my services, my own houses and my real estate customers' houses. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different prices and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who described to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental house. When I called and he recommended me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working once again, he assisted me trouble shoot the concern. He is honest, trustworthy, and affordable on rate. It's difficult to discover a sincere AC person and I'm pleased I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
