<p>Great service within 24 hr and a fair cost. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and really extensive in discussing what services would be carried out. Similarly Camryn provided excellent customer care at the end of the visit by describing exactly what he had actually done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a couple of suggestions of some maintenance jobs we might want to have done in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale strategies employed by some in the market.<p>
<p>PE companies tend to operate with the objective of selling or spinning off a firm eventually. This might be through a public offering, a sale to a big service in the field, or perhaps a sale to another PE firm. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE firm Ares Management. Ares bought CoolSys from Audex, another PE company, earlier this year. Audex had owned CoolSys for three years before that.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
