<p>It is common to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical product over time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
