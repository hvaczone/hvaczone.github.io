According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are typically 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and sometimes these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the very same pollutants. In other words, in some cases the air inside can be more damaging than the air exterior.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily change back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
