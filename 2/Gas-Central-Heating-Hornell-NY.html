<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to assist keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best.

A 2500 square foot house will need a much bigger AC system than a smaller home, which will impact installation expenses. Also a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air circulation will need far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfortable. Other factors that can impact this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems.

CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
