<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash being available in every month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to use automobile debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There should not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>

<h3>Fixing Your Boiler in Succasunna NJ</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outdoor  unit rather of ducting air directly from the outside unit. Indoor units with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>Oil heaters tend to be greater in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which requires to be correctly vented and cleaned from the furnace regularly. Modification the filters occasionally and have your ductwork cleaned up since the soot develops inside the ducts, lowering their effectiveness in time. Expect to service your furnace annual at a cost of around $200, change your filters every 1 - 3 months, and clean your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running optimally.<p>
