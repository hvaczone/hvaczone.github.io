<p>A packaged unit, typically installed on the roof, is most commonly used on commercial structures, however it is also an alternative for house owners to consider. Oftentimes, these systems include not just the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this unit is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those wanting to save cash on the installation of a new heating and cooling system individually, considering that the system is integrated. However, one con is that these units are generally just readily available for larger houses due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be a good way to save cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than purchasing just a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the best alternative for house owners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
