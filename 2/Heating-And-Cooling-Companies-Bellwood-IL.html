Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
