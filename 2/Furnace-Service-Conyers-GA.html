<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
