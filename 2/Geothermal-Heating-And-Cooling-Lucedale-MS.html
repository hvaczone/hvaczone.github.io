This lessens the interior system footprint and enables each space to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to supply heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioner into a heatpump While space cooling supplies maximum flexibility, when utilized to cool numerous spaces at a time it is generally more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
