<p>Truth: Federal and local rewards typically amount to in between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can often make the initial cost of a system competitive with traditional devices. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capacity, during brand-new building and construction (homes typically utilize in between one and 5 tons). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per load, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per lot. However, brand-new installation practices are minimizing expenses, to the point where the cost is getting closer to conventional systems under the ideal conditions.<p>
