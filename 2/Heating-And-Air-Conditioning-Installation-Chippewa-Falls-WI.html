<h3>Recognizing the Importance of HVAC Systems in Chippewa Falls WI</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were really happy that someone as experienced as Adam had the ability to return and repair the air conditioner. We had purchased the club member maintenance plan, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to evaluate the a/c before you buy. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam said he had methods to test AC systems even in winter. We wish we had understood him then.<p>
