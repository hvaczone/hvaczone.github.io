<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The selection of indoor units has one limitation: their overall power should not surpass the capacity of the outdoor unit. In practice, nevertheless, it is very common to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor units greater than the outside capacity by at least 20%. However, it is incorrect to expect better efficiency when all indoor systems are switched on at the very same time, given that the total capability of the whole system is restricted by the capacity of the outside unit. Simply put, the outdoor unit will disperse all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that a few of the spaces may not have a really comfortable temperature level.
