<p>Cooling can likewise be offered by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently decreasing its efficiency.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning is a high-end not everybody can manage, a lot of Seattleites must discover ways to fight the heat without a duct system.

Meanwhile, in big box stores like Best Buy, package fans and window AC units are taken up as quickly as they're stacked in flooring displays. Seattle might be the last city in the country to face the reality of a terrible, harsh summer season.<p>
