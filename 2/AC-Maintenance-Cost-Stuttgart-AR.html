<p>Lead has actually long been recognized as a hazardous toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Person Services called lead the " top environmental danger to the health of kids in the United States." There are numerous ways in which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, polluted soil, weakening paint, and dust.

Before it was known how harmful lead might be, it was used in paint, gasoline, water pipes, and numerous other products.<p>
