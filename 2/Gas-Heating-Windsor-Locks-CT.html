<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly receives ask for consultation and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation procedure. Nevertheless, a lot of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.)
