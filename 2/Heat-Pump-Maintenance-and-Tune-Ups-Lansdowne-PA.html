<h3>HVAC Service Technician in Lansdowne PA 19050</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that the SEER ranking is calculated utilizing the very same set of temperatures across the board. The typical summer season temperature to come to the SEER score is 83 degrees, so to arrive at the correct SEER ranking for your area, subtract 2 points for every single 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER score has to be at least 13 for all new cooling systems produced in the United States.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO protect the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, several research studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor carefully, many of the 'respectable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales methods that DO make the most of uninformed homeowners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a trustworthy company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
