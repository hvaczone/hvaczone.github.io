<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take a picture of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may need a recommendation later). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Photo 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
