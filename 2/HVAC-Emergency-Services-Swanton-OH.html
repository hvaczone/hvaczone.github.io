<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not offer them.  Secondly like extended auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the necessary abilities to do the task and also the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. Many companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to correctly service and the system has been operating issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
