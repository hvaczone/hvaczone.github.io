<p>Information offered in this security guide is based on present scientific and technical understanding of the concerns presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional borders established by the statutes governing the co-authoring firms. The standards do not require you to change your existing central air systems, and replacement parts and services must still be offered for your house's systems.

Producers usually continue to support existing equipment by making replacement parts available and honoring maintenance contracts after the brand-new standard goes into effect.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outdoor system as near to your house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
