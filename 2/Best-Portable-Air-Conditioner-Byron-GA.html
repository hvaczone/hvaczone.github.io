<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task locating the outside system as near to your house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
