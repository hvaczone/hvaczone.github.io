<p>Heaters are appliances whose purpose is to produce heat (i.e. heat) for the structure.

<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a hard task that the workers sweat and bleed at, particularly residential service. When there is no work there is no pay.

You have a great Tech PM your system, he is paying costs and must not "need" to offer you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on.

<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality at Hillsboro MO</h3>
<p>Factors that can contribute to the development of biological pollutants are damp or damp building products (carpeting, ceilings, walls) and improperly maintained humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioning system. "Humidifier fever" is a common disease caused by inappropriate maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and relentless coughs. Numerous fungis and germs grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these impurities can be dispersed into the air and inhaled by the building residents. Other possible sources of biological contaminants are pets and household plants.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
