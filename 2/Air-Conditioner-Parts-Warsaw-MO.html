<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, specifically in summer. Connection concerns along the line that supplies power to your furnace can jeopardize the efficiency of the system.

<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to change your filters regularly, they're not kidding. It's as essential as a regular oil modification in your cars and truck. A filthy filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps impurities and particles in the air. As soon as every three months, Energy Star suggests replacing your filter. During high usage months, check the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>

Compare the numerous furnace effectiveness scores suggested by the private contractors to choose the model and system that best fits your energy needs. Bear in mind that energy-star rated equipment will conserve you money in the end but might involve a greater up-front cost.<p>
