<p>When our furnace was passing away, we called two local companies for quotes. While both were informative and valuable, Ballard Natural Gas provided us a much better deal, for extraordinary service. Instead of a simple sales task, the owner of the company made a full assessment of our heater and located methods we could have more even heat. He included these considerable but minor changes in his quote. Since of current warmer summer seasons and for ecological reasons, we chose to alter from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>
<p>I have actually been operating in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a hard task that the employees sweat and bleed at, specifically residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with clients and keeps people working. When a sales man comes to your house he exists to sell, that is the only way he is paid. You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying expenses and should not "need" to sell you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I offer you the options for your requirements and you decide if you require it.<p>

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the eye, nose, and throat and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that duplicated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at particular danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and people with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more tough to manage than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity should be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to reduce mold growth.<p>
<p>HVAC is an abbreviation for Ventilation, air and heating Conditioning, and describes the environment control systems installed in houses or commercial properties. Their job is to move heated or cooled filtered air throughout the structure, to keep occupants of the structure comfortable. Actually every structure in Columbus or Franklin County, Ohio or the United States has some sort of climate control system set up.<p>
