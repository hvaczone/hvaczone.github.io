That's since it runs at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to offer a particular cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling expenses than equipment set up simply a few years ago.<p>

If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
