<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually become aware of the $5000 guideline however got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

When going shopping for a new AC system, these are just a few of the factors that you require to take into account. Each choice can and will substantially impact your system's efficiency, which is why you can't afford to disregard any of them.<p>
