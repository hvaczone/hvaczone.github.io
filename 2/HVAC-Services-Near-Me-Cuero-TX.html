He dedicated to the job based just on emails, appeared and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the few affordable ones got. Others were nearly two times the amount Protex estimated for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex properly encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up group was respectful of my house and set up the devices in the expected amount of time. post set up evaluation outcomes look very good for braising and pipes quality. New system cools better than the 13 year old 4 load R22 system it replaced (also Carrier).<p>
