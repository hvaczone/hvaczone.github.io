<p>Packaged terminal ac system (PTAC) systems are also called wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have 2 separate units (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This decreases the interior system footprint and permits each room to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems might be adjusted to supply heating in cold weather, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the a/c into a heat pump While room cooling provides maximum versatility, when utilized to cool lots of rooms at a time it is normally more costly than central air.<p>

<p>Central air conditioning is a high-end not everybody can manage, many Seattleites must discover ways to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. Meanwhile, in big box shops like Best Buy, the box fans and window AC units are nabbed up as soon as they're stacked in floor display screens.
