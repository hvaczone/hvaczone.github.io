<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't offer them.  Second of all like extended car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary skills to do the job and also the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be completely made the most of. The majority of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly found someone to properly service and the unit has actually been operating problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
