<p>SysTech Style focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and preserving the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your home. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>

PTACs, which are often utilized in hotels, have two different systems (terminal bundles), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening travelling through the wall and linking them.
