<h3>HVAC Repair Warnings You Should Not Ignore Clinton MD</h3>
<p>Initially, unlike central air, you have a few choices when it comes to central heating systems. We'll delve into costs later on, however you can choose from a furnace, boiler or heat  pump. In general, heating systems are the most economical alternative. Nevertheless, your choice will mainly boil down to what your ducts permit or what was previously in your home. Ask your heating contractor for the most suitable choice.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
