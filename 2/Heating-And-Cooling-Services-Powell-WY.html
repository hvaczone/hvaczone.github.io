Atmospheric pressure distinctions developed by these forces move airborne pollutants from locations of greater pressure to locations of lower pressure through any readily available opening in building walls, ceilings, floorings, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is small, air will move till the inside pressure is equal to the outside.<p>
