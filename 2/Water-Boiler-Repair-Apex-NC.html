<h3>Heat Pump Cost in Apex North Carolina</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
