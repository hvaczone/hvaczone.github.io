<p>Exposure Control: Changing the time and location of toxin direct exposure. An example of time control is scheduling flooring waxing and stripping (with the ventilation system operating) on a Friday. This allows items to off-gas over the weekend while most of the staff are at home over the weekend. Location control includes moving the contaminant source away from occupants or even transferring prone occupants.<p>
<p>Indoor air quality (likewise called "indoor ecological quality") explains how within air can affect a person's health, comfort, and capability to work. It can include temperature level, humidity, lack of outdoors air (bad ventilation), mold from water damage, or direct exposure to other chemicals. Presently, OSHA has no indoor air quality (IAQ) requirements but it does supply guidelines about the most typical IAQ work environment problems.<p>
<p>Both the active and inert ingredients in pesticides can be natural compounds; therefore, both might contribute to the levels of air-borne organics inside homes.
