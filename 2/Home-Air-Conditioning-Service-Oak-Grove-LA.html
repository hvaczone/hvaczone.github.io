<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
