<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that gain access to would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity professional at a big seller who asked not to be called since he did not have permission to speak on the record, it is common for large retail operations to have a team that regularly keeps an eye on energy usage and temperature levels in shops to minimize costs (especially during the night) and to alert shop supervisors if temperatures in the stores change beyond an acceptable range that might prevent clients from shopping at the store.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to offer your home that best temperature throughout the year. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing some of those typical air contaminants. Ultimately, their air filters fill and stop doing their task. Not only does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can lead to pricey repairs down the roadway. So, make sure to alter your AC filters frequently, or get an air conditioning service plan which typically consists of a filter change - especially if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
