<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you would not offer them.  Second of all like prolonged auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the essential skills to do the task and also the morals to treat customers relatively. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. Many companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly found someone to appropriately service and the system has been operating issue complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
