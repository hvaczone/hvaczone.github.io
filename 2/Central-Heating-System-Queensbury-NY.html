<p>Wetness management and humidity control needs operating HVAC systems as developed. Moisture management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to attempt to enhance the operation to save energy. For instance, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide makeup air at lower temperatures (style levels), instead of the greater temperatures sometimes utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for the majority of the US and many parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need further cooling to supply thermal comfort inside. However, high humidity outdoors produces the need for careful attention to humidity levels inside your home. High humidities generate mold development and wetness indoors is related to a greater frequency of occupant breathing problems.<p>
