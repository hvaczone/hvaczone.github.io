<h3>Why Choose a Pure Gas Furnace in Mauston WI?</h3>
<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the procedure of exchanging or replacing air in any area to offer high indoor air quality which includes temperature control, oxygen replenishment, and elimination of wetness, smells, smoke, heat, dust, airborne bacteria, co2, and other gases. Ventilation gets rid of unpleasant smells and extreme moisture, presents outside air, keeps interior structure air circulating, and avoids stagnation of the interior air.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and courteous. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
