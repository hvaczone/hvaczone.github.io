<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Advice For Richland Center WI Home Owners</h3>
<p>A hydronic radiant flooring heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a labyrinth of pipes installed under the flooring or right within the flooring surface itself. The heat from the warm water transfers to the floor mass and then radiates through thermal transfer to other posts with strong mass such as the walls, ceilings, furniture and people. It does not rely on heating or moving air to move heat.<p>
