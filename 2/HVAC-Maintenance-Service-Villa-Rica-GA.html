<h3>Commercial Air Conditioner in Villa Rica GA 30180</h3>
<p>I normally do not leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate needing to replace your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my options. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over options. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the eye, nose, and throat and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal studies that duplicated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at specific danger from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and people with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO maintain the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. Nevertheless, select your contractor sensibly, much of the 'reliable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales tactics that DO benefit from uninformed homeowners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a respectable company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos items include vinyl asbestos floor tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement products. When they are dealt with in a method that creates dust containing asbestos fibers which can be inhaled, these products provide a danger only. When asbestos-containing materials are damaged or disturbed by repair, remodeling, or demolition activities, tiny fibers can become airborne if appropriate controls are not in place. This can lead to the potential for significant health problems.<p>
