On those days when you just can't appear to warm up and find you require to turn up your thermostat, your furnace can suck all the humidity out of your home and leave your sinuses throbbing. Due to the fact that they heat surfaces and not the air itself, in-floor heater are not susceptible to this problem. Additionally, considering that they do not trust fans, ducts, registers and returns to disperse hot air, in-floor heating unit can lower the amount of dust and seasonal allergens in your house.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the room temperature, and then switch it ON. To prevent straining an air conditioning system's compressor, wait a minimum of 5 minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, try to find an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
