<p>I have been using them for many years for my organisations, my own homes and my realty customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with various costs and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who described to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. He helped me problem shoot the concern when I called and he recommended me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working once again. He is sincere, trusted, and reasonable on rate. It's hard to discover a sincere AC person and I'm thankful I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
