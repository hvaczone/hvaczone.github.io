<p>You're motivating the growth of mold in wet air if you set it too low. The heat dries the air, avoiding mold growth and pollution. Obviously, too-dry air can also aggravate your lungs and sinuses, while excessive indoor humidity can add to the growth of bacteria and viruses, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Health and Environmental Health. The ideal humidity in a home is around half, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>The majority of well and city water does not typically consist of lead. Water typically picks up lead inside the house from family pipes that is made with lead products. The only method to understand if there is lead in drinking water is to have it tested. Contact the local health department or the water provider to find out how to get the water tested. Send for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for more details about what you can do if you have actually lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) to learn more.<p>

<p>Biological impurities include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transmitted by animals and people; bacteria are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. It can end up being air-borne when it dries. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these pollutants through the house.<p>
