<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things first. Make certain all the registers in your home are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the decreased air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've solved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
