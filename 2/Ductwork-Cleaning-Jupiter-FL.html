<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air problems by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often release contaminants.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outside air penetrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Second, identification of impurity sources is often crucial to determining the cause( s) of employee health symptoms. Such information can often be gotten by asking for copies of air monitoring data from the company. If monitoring data is not readily available, yet a high variety of health symptoms have been reported, the Union representative need to ask for that the company have air tracking tests carried out. Evaluation of this data may recognize potentially hazardous sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. Nevertheless, when pollutant concentrations are extremely low, keeping an eye on data may not describe the observed or reported health signs.<p>
