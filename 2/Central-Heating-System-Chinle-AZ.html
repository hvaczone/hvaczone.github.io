<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by building, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into buildings via mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>

For example, a heat exchanger may fail too soon since the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering early deterioration, leading to holes and fractures. , if that client had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and protects the component.. a very helpful outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that potentially saved a client thousands.<p>
