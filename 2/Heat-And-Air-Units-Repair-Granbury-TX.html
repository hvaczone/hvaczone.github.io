<h3>Boiler Heating System in Granbury TX 76049</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle ac system". The heatpump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise switches functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
