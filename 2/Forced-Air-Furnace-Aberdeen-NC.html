<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and maintaining the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment.

Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils.

It likewise avoids water from accumulating on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
