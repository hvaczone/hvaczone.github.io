<p>Professional heating system installations. However, even the best-maintained heater will eventually fail.

<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac systems and thermostats have built-in hold-up features. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually subscribed to an energy-saving device from your local power energy, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts shown and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature level, and the system does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of breathing infection; there is also proof from animal studies that repeated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. People at specific risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and people with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
