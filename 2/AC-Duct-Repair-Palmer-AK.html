<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't offer off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can take place gradually due to the fact that of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to do the trick until you buy a replacement-- which you should do soon.<p>
<p>In addition to the customer evaluations, you can learn a lot about an HVAC company by any awards they get. There are lots of organizations that work hard to assist inform the general public about numerous companies. Angie's List might award a Super Service Award to the very best HVAC company.
