<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
