<h3>Is The Furnace Running at Top Efficiency in Seekonk MA?</h3>
<p>When you and your family walk into your home in Sacramento, CA, are you as comfortable as you can be? Do you discover it to be either too cold throughout the winter season or too warm in areas during the summer season? Whether you're having a problem with uneven cooling or heating, or your indoor air quality isn't up to par, Sierra Pacific Home & Convenience, Inc. has the product or services you need.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
