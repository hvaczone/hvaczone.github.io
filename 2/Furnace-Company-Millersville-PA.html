<p>Ac system manufacturers usually make rugged, high quality products. Begin by inspecting any fuses or circuit breakers if your air conditioner stops working. Let the unit cool off for about 5 minutes before resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limit switch may have tripped; reset it by pressing the button, situated in the compressor's gain access to panel.<p>
