<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heating systems are still extensively utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat.
