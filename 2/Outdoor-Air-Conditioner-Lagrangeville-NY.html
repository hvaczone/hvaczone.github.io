<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the price great but Mark went out of his method to personalize a few things in my home to make the total air flow more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
