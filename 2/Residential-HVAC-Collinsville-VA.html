<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so work with your contractor to find a place that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Due to the fact that it exhausts warm air out the top, don't place the condenser under a deck or totally enclose it. Any airflow limitation will reduce the unit's efficiency. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily distribute around it.<p>
<p>Geographically, some locations pay consistently higher incomes for air conditioning tradespersons.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should momentarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
