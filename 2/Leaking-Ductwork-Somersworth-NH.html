Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the conventional hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe getting in and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperatures are high, and the standard hot water heater can be turned off completely.<p>
<p>The primary problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, workers try to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal.

The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the a/c individually for each room. However, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>
