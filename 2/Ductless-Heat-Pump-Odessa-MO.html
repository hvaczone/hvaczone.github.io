<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine components. To avoid this from happening, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs handled by experts, check out Eric's Garage today.<p>

The lowest performance enabled by law for brand-new gas designs is 78%, and there are various alternatives that achieve 98%, for near total efficiency.<p>
