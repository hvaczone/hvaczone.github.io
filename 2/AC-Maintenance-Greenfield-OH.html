<p>Packaged terminal a/c (PTAC) systems are also referred to as wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have 2 separate units (terminal packages), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening going through the wall and connecting them. This lessens the interior system footprint and permits each space to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems may be adapted to supply heating in cold weather, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioning unit into a heatpump While space air conditioning supplies optimum flexibility, when used to cool many spaces at a time it is usually more expensive than central air.<p>
