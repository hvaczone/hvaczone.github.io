<p>Central air is a high-end not everybody can pay for, a lot of Seattleites need to discover methods to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. Meanwhile, in big box stores like Finest Buy, package fans and window AC systems are snatched up as quickly as they're stacked in flooring screens. Seattle may be the last city in the nation to deal with the truth of a terrible, vicious summer.<p>
<p>Have actually utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They offer me top priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy prolonged service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent investment in my viewpoint. Never try to sell me something I do not require.<p>
